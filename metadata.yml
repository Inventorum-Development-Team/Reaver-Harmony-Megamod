#           - Engineers and scientists cost a bit less and their salaries have been reduced slightly.
#           - Powered melee weapons now cost elerium instead of alien alloys to make. This better fits their research
#               requirements while also giving a more powerful way to earn profit manufacturing earlier in the game.

#       * You can now tell upper ranks from lower ranks visually with some alien races.
#       * Snakeman Queen mechanics greatly improved. (Still likely buggy!)

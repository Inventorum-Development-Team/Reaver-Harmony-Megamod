#       * Greatly increased armor values on all types of power armor.
#           - Power armor on hard difficulty now has more armor than power armor on easy difficulty previously had.
#           - Terrorist units have had their attacks buffed slightly to compensate for this change.
#       * Added Habitat Flora item from salvaging Alien Habitat.
#       * Fixed bug with Shotgun handobs sprite.
#  1.0.3:   Fixed bug with snakeman queen not appearing inside snakeman colony.

#           - The Council now pays a one-time bonus each month based on your monthly score, with the most noticeable
#               difference happening at very high scores. There is no bonus or penalty for a negative score.
#           - Engineers and scientists cost a bit less and their salaries have been reduced slightly.
#           - Powered melee weapons now cost elerium instead of alien alloys to make. This better fits their research
#               requirements while also giving a more powerful way to earn profit manufacturing earlier in the game.
#           - Tractor beam research and manufacture path made a bit easier to get started on.
#       * Spacecraft fuel costs 2.5x as much deuterium now; also fixed spacecraft fuel sell value being incorrect.

#       * Increased General Stores capacity from 30/180 to 50/300.
#       * Civilians will no longer pick up alien weapons. They also won't pick up weapons you throw to them.

#       * Soldiers and items should now start inside the exit area of the alien base.
#       * Heavy Destroyer now has its own interception image; Light Destroyer interception image updated.
#       * You can now tell upper ranks from lower ranks visually with some alien races.
#       * Snakeman Queen mechanics greatly improved. (Still likely buggy!)
#       * Various small bug fixes and balance tweaks.
#  1.0.5:   Updated interception images for Covert Ops, Patroller, and Light Destroyer.
#       * Reduced Harvester speed from 4000 to 3600 to make it easier to catch with tractor beams.
#       * Reduced Medium Destroyer speed from 4500 to 4000 to better match its size.
#       * Reduced Heavy Destroyer speed from 5400 to 5000 to better match its size.
#       * Increased Battleship speed from 5200 to 5400 to make it once again the fastest UFO type.
#       * Increased Mothership speed from 3700 to 3900 to better match its size.
#       * Rebalanced destroyer hunt speeds.
#       * Added new bigobs for security turrets.
#       * Fixed bug in which tractor beams were not draining shields.
#  1.0.6:   Cannons and launchers with multiple ammo types now show which ammo is loaded via the sprite.
#       * Minor tweaks to various cannon or launcher sprites; new sprite for Blaster Launcher.
#       * Heavy and rapid-fire weaponry now punch through terrain more easily than before.
#       * Added defense system facility which is powered by Alien Explosive missiles.
#       * Nerfed Exterminator speed a bit; buffed Interceptor, Interdictor, and Executioner speed significantly.
#           - The Exterminator's maximum speed is 170 knots over the Executioner, down from 530 knots over.
#           - Tier 1 top speed with 1 weapon on Skyraider is 50 knots under Interceptor, down from 150 knots over.
#       * The fuel capacity and fuel efficiency of spacecraft (but not Flagships) have been reduced by 1/3rd.
#           - The Heracles is now more fuel efficient than the Firestorm.
#           - Power Sources and Subjugator Combos had their fuel capacity reduced by 1/3rd.
#           - Combat Suite fuel capacity reduced by 5/9ths.
#           - Recon Suite fuel capacity doubled, shields cut in half. Manufacturing recipe and sell value updated.
#           **Note:** It is easy to extend spacecraft flight range with either engines or power sources.
#       * Updated UFOPedia to reflect aircraft and spacecraft defense changes from 1.0.2.
#       * Optimized interception image for Heavy Destroyer.
#       * Fixed storage sizes of some items.
#       * Alien Alloys no longer grant points when recovered.
#       * Aliens recover from stun more quickly than before. This was supposed to have been implemented earlier.
#       * Reduced time to salvage Power Source and Navigation. This also was supposed to be implemented earlier.
#       * Snakeman Colony missions complete rapidly, as they were supposed to before.
#       * Ethereal Navigator Corpse now yields 2 Psionic Wave Emitters.
#       * Ethereal Garrison race now has fewer Mutons and more Ethereals.
#       * Muton Garrison race now has fewer Ethereal Leaders, and will spawn Ethereal Taskmasters instead.
#       * UFO dodge chance listed in UFOPedia now follows a better system; actual UFO dodge chance is not changed.
#           - To estimate your odds of hitting: weapon hit chance + bonus hit - enemy evasion
#               - Example: Starling (90%) vs Medium Scout (-26%) = 64, so you need ~36% bonus to guarantee a hit.
#       * Minimum turns for bughunt mode varies by mission, with small missions allowing it to activate much earlier.
#       * Item sorting in base stores improved.
#       * Repaired various minor holes in UFO walls, 47 maps updated.
#       * Several small updates to base defense terrain: less holes, more/better spawn nodes, better looking.
#       * Several other tiny changes. Full details are available in the GitHub logs.
#  1.0.7:   Night operations armors have received a buff to their stealth and night vision.
#           - The buff is strongest on the ones which were previously weak, and negligible on the top ones.
#       * Tanks have had their light radius increased, and are now less blinded by smoke.
#       * The night vision of some alien races has been reduced, but it is still a lot more than your soldiers.
#           - Having longer night vision range than certain alien types is now more achievable than before.
#       * Fixed a bug with proximity grenades acting like regular grenades.
#       * Fixed bug in which security station facility was not properly being destroyed during base defense.
#       * Doors on security stations no longer block turret fire.

#       * Sectoid Armor shows up more gradually, less abruptly.
#       * Weapons now show their optimal range per shot type in the UFOPedia.
#       * Laser Pulse Rifle sprite updated (again).
#       * Added a scope to Plasma Rifle.
#       * Tractor beams shield drain rate doubled.
#       * The lifts which appear on some X-Com spacecraft will now block line of sight and line of fire.
#       * Added several more entries to Research Project Information.
#       * Slightly reduced battlescape size for mediums, larges, and Battleship.
#       * Added space suits for non-power armor when going to Cydonia.
#       * Cydonia has lower gravity, so your soldiers are now stronger on Cydonia.
#       * Improved alien and civilian spawning on vanilla outdoor terrains.
#       * Fixed bug with Snakeman Queen text.
#       * Fixed sound bug at Snakeman Queen's lair.
#       * Made a few tiny balance adjustments involving aircraft research and tanks.
#       * Fixed other minor text, sound, and graphical bugs.
#  1.0.7.1: Proximity grenades should actually be fixed now!
#       * Added some missing text in statstrings.rul.
#  1.0.8:   Buffed Calamity Launcher ammo.
#         - Rebalanced Power Suit Weapon manufacture costs a bit.
#         - Did full balance pass on Calamity Launcher ammo manufacturing, was supposed to be done before 1.0.
#       * Gave the Combat Suite its +10% hit bonus back.
#       * Increased Craft Light Plasma ammo max from 12 to 15.
#       * Buffed AE Missile, Laser, and Plasma Base Defenses.
#       * You can now only build one Grav Shield per base. (This prevents building useless excess!)
#       * Shrunk several UFO components, most notably alloys, deuterium, and most forms of salvage.
#       * New kind of salvage added: alien storage repositories. These are particularly abundant within outposts.
#       * Snakeman Queen scavenge recipe added.
#       * Race weights adjusted: Ethereals should be more common in the late game now.
#       * Psi Adepts now screen better for bravery than Elites do.
#       * Adjusted value of flagship diode components in order to increase the reward for dangerous interceptions.
#       * Heavy Destroyers might be way more common during alien invasion campaign in the late game.
#       * Fixed a bug in which terror sites were not always granting the terror site data cache.
#       * Fixed bug in which Combat and Recon Suite UFOPedia reports would not reveal once you had access to them.

  STR_UFO_POWER_SOURCE_UFOPEDIA: "The power source of alien craft is an anti-matter reactor which uses Elerium (element 115) to generate powerful gravity waves as well as other forms of energy. The conversion of matter to energy is an incredible 99% efficient, therefore tiny quantities of Elerium can produce a huge amount of power. We can design power systems along the same principles, but we cannot truly replicate this advanced technology.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}This technology will be instrumental in advancing our understanding of alien weapon design."
  STR_UFO_NAVIGATION_UFOPEDIA: "Alien craft use sophisticated computers to navigate on earth and through space. The system is based on optical processors arranged in network fashion. The control interface is relatively simple - the navigator controls the direction of gravity waves generated by the power source to move the craft in any direction. This system can be used easily by humans, however it will take years before we can reproduce this extremely complex design."
  STR_UFO_CONSTRUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Alien craft consist of three main components - a power source, a navigation system and a hull built from alien alloys. The hull is specially designed to allow gravity waves to be directed and controlled. In addition a small quantity of Elerium is required to fuel the power source. Once the principles of construction are understood, and the functions of each component are known, then it is possible to build these types of craft."
  STR_ALIEN_FOOD_UFOPEDIA: "These chambers contain various enzymes which are used to digest the body parts of cattle, other animals and even humans. The liquid is then consumed as ready digested food - probably direct to the bloodstream. This suggests a certain dependence on earth for food - a symbiosis between earth and alien society."
  STR_ALIEN_REPRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "These chambers contain alien foetuses. The design of these containers seems to suggest that the aliens which use this process rely completely on laboratory reproduction. The rich nutrients ensure rapid development of the foetus. This factory line system could generate thousands of alien clones in a short space of time. The process could be easily adapted for human reproduction, or alien-human hybrids."
  STR_ALIEN_ENTERTAINMENT_UFOPEDIA: "The most likely function of these screens is recreational. The psionic circuitry stimulates various centers of the brain. The effect is similar to hallucinogenic drugs. This is the only evidence that aliens have any cultural or recreational pastimes."
  STR_ALIEN_SURGERY_UFOPEDIA: "This surgical equipment uses laser cutters to extract certain body parts from cattle and other animals. The widespread cattle mutilations can be accounted for by this bizarre alien activity. It is likely that these parts are used for nutritional or genetic purposes."
  STR_EXAMINATION_ROOM_UFOPEDIA: "In the past many thousands of people have claimed to have been abducted by aliens, sometimes repeatedly. The truth is far more horrific. Humans are abducted, researched and monitored. The best specimens have genetic material extracted. Women have human-alien hybrid foetuses implanted, and then removed several months later. Who knows what sinister motives the aliens have?"

  STR_HOSPITAL_UFOPEDIA: "The large medical facility is fully equipped to take care of the needs of wounded soldiers, including intensive care and surgery. With a hospital in the base, soldiers will recover from injuries much more quickly."
  STR_BIOLOGICAL_ALTERATIONS_CENTER_UFOPEDIA: "This facility employs alien surgery and genetic implantation technology and equipment in order to enable us to transform our soldiers into superhuman warriors. It is also equipped with cloning vats and it can be used to rapidly grow tissue grafts and organs. With this facility in the base, grievously injured soldiers can be promptly returned to service."
  STR_LIVING_QUARTERS_UFOPEDIA: "Each accommodation block provides for up to 25 personnel. The facility provides basic recreation, food and sleeping areas."
  STR_LIVING_QUARTERS_LARGE_UFOPEDIA: "This large facility is more space-efficient and can house up to 125 personnel in improved comfort."
  STR_GENERAL_STORES_UFOPEDIA: "This facility adds 30 space units to base storage capacity. All equipment, weapons systems, munitions, recovered material and Heavy Weapons Platforms are placed in stores, including equipment assigned to craft in hangars. While several facilities have their own storage space, a general stores facility can be built to expand available space."
  STR_GENERAL_STORES_LARGE_UFOPEDIA: "This large facility is more space-efficient and can store a large amount of equipment and supplies, increasing storage capacity in the base by 180 space units."
  STR_LABORATORY_UFOPEDIA: "Up to 25 scientists can work in a laboratory facility. Laboratories are equipped with the latest technology for research into materials, biochemistry and cosmology. There is privileged access to the best research labs throughout the world, including military establishments."
  STR_LABORATORY_LARGE_UFOPEDIA: "The large laboratory has more powerful equipment and better space efficiency, enabling up to 125 scientists to occupy the facility."
  STR_WORKSHOP_UFOPEDIA: "A workshop contains all the equipment necessary to manufacture equipment based on designs from the science labs. Up to 25 engineers can occupy a workshop, although items under construction may also consume some space."
  STR_WORKSHOP_LARGE_UFOPEDIA: "The large workshop has more powerful equipment and better space efficiency, enabling up to 125 engineers to occupy the facility. Items under construction may consume some space."
  STR_ALIEN_CONTAINMENT_UFOPEDIA: "Living aliens require a special habitat to maintain their life systems. The containment facility can keep up to 5 alien life forms in self-contained units. They are fed a prepared nutrient solution intravenously and receive psionic feedback from an entertainment device installed in the facility."
  STR_ALIEN_CONTAINMENT_LARGE_UFOPEDIA: "The large alien containment is vastly more space-efficient than the small one. Inside the facility is a large habitat which can house up to 50 alien life forms, and it provides for all of the aliens' needs while allowing them to roam freely throughout the habitat. The facility is secured with small exits and mind suppression devices."
  STR_MISSILE_DEFENSES_UFOPEDIA: "Missile defences provide some protection against incursion by hostile craft which are attempting to land near the base.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Missile Defences can damage an incoming alien vessel, reducing the number of combatants aboard, or destroy it entirely. You will need a total defence strength of at least 500 in order to reliably shoot down the smaller retaliation craft.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Ensure base is stocked with Base Defence Missiles. It takes one set of missiles to fire once."
  STR_MISSILE_DEFENSES_AE_UFOPEDIA: "Alien Explosive missile defences provide greatly improved protection against hostile craft.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}AE Defences can damage an incoming alien vessel, reducing the number of combatants aboard, or destroy it entirely. You will need a total defence strength of at least 1200 in order to reliably shoot down the larger retaliation craft.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Ensure base is stocked with Base Defence AE Missiles. It takes one set of missiles to fire once."
  STR_LASER_DEFENSES_UFOPEDIA: "Laser defences provide effective and efficient protection against incursion by hostile craft.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Laser Defences can damage an incoming alien vessel, reducing the number of combatants aboard, or destroy it entirely. You will need a total defence strength of at least 1200 in order to reliably shoot down the larger retaliation craft."
  STR_PLASMA_DEFENSES_UFOPEDIA: "Plasma beam defences provide powerful but expensive protection against incursion by hostile craft.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Plasma Defences can damage an incoming alien vessel, reducing the number of combatants aboard, or destroy it entirely. You will need a total defence strength of at least 2500 in order to reliably shoot down the largest retaliation craft.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Ensure base is stocked with special Base Defence Plasma ammo."
  STR_FUSION_BALL_DEFENSES_UFOPEDIA: "We have developed a Fusion Beam which operates without the use of rare Elerium fuel, allowing our bases to be superbly defended for years to come. We cannot miniaturise this technology enough to mount it onto an aircraft.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Fusion Beam Defences can destroy some of the largest vessels in one or two shots, and do not need to be supplied with special ammo."
  STR_SMALL_RADAR_SYSTEM_UFOPEDIA: "This detection system has an effective radar range of 1800 nautical miles and is linked to satellite systems for ground search. It has a 10% chance of detecting an average sized object every 30 minutes. Building more of the same type of radar at a base does not extend detection range, but it does increase the chance of detection."
  STR_LARGE_RADAR_FACILITY_UFOPEDIA: "The large detection system has an effective range of 2800 nautical miles and is linked to satellite systems for ground search. It has a 15% chance of detecting an average sized object every 30 minutes. Building more of the same type of radar at a base does not extend detection range, but it does increase the chance of detection."
  STR_MIND_SHIELD_UFOPEDIA: "Since alien craft rely on brain waves to detect human presence, the most effective countermeasure is to shield brain waves from the base. This facility will significantly reduce the chances of detection by alien craft. Building more of these facilities will improve the brain wave suppression, but the base will never be completely undetectable."
  STR_MIND_SHIELD_LARGE_UFOPEDIA: "The large mind shield contains a set of computer systems which read local mind waves and generate destructive interference. This facility is able to suppress brain waves as effectively as ten small mind shields. There is a diminishing return from operating multiple mind shields at once, and a large mind shield is a lot more effective than four small mind shields."
  STR_PSIONIC_LABORATORY_UFOPEDIA: "The psionics lab can give soldiers the necessary training to improve their psionic skills and defence. Each lab can train up to ten soldiers. The more psionic aliens and devices we research, the better the psionic tools we can build for our soldiers to use. Training will not improve psi strength.{NEWLINE}PSIONIC STRENGTH: This is the measure of a soldier's natural potential for psionics. A higher psionic strength improves their ability to both use and resist psionic attacks.{NEWLINE}PSIONIC SKILL: This is how much training the soldier has had with psionics. A better trained soldier is slightly more resistant to psionic attacks, but is much more capable of using them."
  STR_HYPER_WAVE_DECODER_UFOPEDIA: "Alien communications rely on a supra-dimensional wave which travels almost instantaneously. The decoder facility intercepts UFO transmissions out to a range of 2100 nautical miles, and decodes the information. This facility has a 67% chance to detect an average sized UFO and will show the type of UFO, the alien race and the type of activity.{NEWLINE}Building more radars in the same base incurs a diminishing return on investment, and there is no significant benefit to having more than two Hyper Wave Decoders at any base."
  STR_HYPER_WAVE_DECODER_LARGE_UFOPEDIA: "The large decoder facility intercepts UFO transmissions out to a range of 3000 nautical miles, and decodes the information. This facility has a 100% chance to detect any size UFO and will show the type of UFO, the alien race and the type of activity."
  STR_SECURITY_ROOM_AP_UFOPEDIA: "A fortified room with positions for soldiers to fight under cover. The room comes equipped with remotely-operated gun turrets which can track and fire upon intruding forces.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Inside the facility there are two Rapid Defence turrets and two Heavy Defence turrets, with different power values and firing speeds.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}TURRET POWER: 25/40 AP         HEALTH: 50      ARMOR: 40{NEWLINE}NUMBER OF TURRETS: 4       ACCURACY: 80"

  STR_CORRIDOR_UFOPEDIA: "A cheap walkway that can be built quickly in order to optimise base design."
  STR_EMPTY_ROOM_UFOPEDIA: "A section of the base which has already been prepared for construction. If you build a facility on top of an empty room, it will be completed significantly faster than when building upon un-excavated ground. You can build a facility even faster when building it on top of a similar facility, for example building a Large Living Quarters on top of four small Living Quarters."

  STR_COMBAT_KNIFE_UFOPEDIA: "DAMAGE:   40% OF STR + 40% OF REACTIONS + 20% OF MELEE ACC{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}A combat blade made of tempered titanium. This is a lightweight, small, and cheap weapon, though deadly at melee range. It is useless at long range, and will find difficulty in penetrating armour, however the soldier's strength and skill will augment the weapon's power. A well-trained melee combatant can seek out the gaps in an opponent's armour and strike where they are most vulnerable."
  STR_POWER_KNIFE_UFOPEDIA: "DAMAGE:   100% OF REACTIONS + 30% OF MELEE ACC{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}This lightweight knife uses a compact power source similar to alien design to generate heat and vibrations focused at its tip. It takes skill to use this weapon well, but it is potent in the right hands. Sleek and deadly, this makes an excellent concealed weapon. The soldier's skill with knives will substantially augment its power."
  STR_POWER_BATON_UFOPEDIA: "DAMAGE BONUS:   10% OF STRENGTH + 10% OF MELEE ACC{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}This baton uses an alien-style power source to generate intense heat and energy at the tip. It is a potent one-hand melee weapon which takes little skill to use properly. Use this as a backup weapon for ranged combat soldiers who might find themselves in a tight situation."
  STR_POWER_SWORD_UFOPEDIA: "DAMAGE:   160% OF STRENGTH + 30% OF MELEE ACC{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}This blade uses an alien-style power source to generate heat and vibrations which enable it to slice through metal with ease. It is a skillful melee weapon which is best used in both hands of a well-trained melee fighter. With enough strength, this weapon could slice a tank in half. The soldier's strength will greatly augment its power."
  STR_STUN_ROD_UFOPEDIA: "DAMAGE BONUS:   30% OF MELEE ACC{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}This device can only be used in close combat, but may stun a living organism without killing it by using electric shocks. Tazers of this variety are actually dangerous to the target, but act much faster than a depressant serum."
  STR_SUPER_STUN_LANCE_UFOPEDIA: "DAMAGE BONUS:   120% OF MELEE ACC{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}This is a high-powered stun device capable of incapacitating a target as large as an elephant. It is highly dangerous to the target and can easily kill a human-sized animal.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}While no civilian agencies have found a use for such a device, we have reason to believe it may be useful to the X-Com Project."
  STR_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "The standard issue X-Com pistol is a high powered semi-automatic with a 12 round capacity. It fires .44 Magnum rounds with excellent armour penetration capability."
  STR_AUTO_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "This is a military-issue submachinegun selected for X-Com use due to its emphasis on power and accuracy over rate of fire. It fires FN-57 5.7mm rounds."
  STR_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "This highly accurate sniper rifle has scoped sights and fires 7.62mm NATO rounds in clips of 15. The powerful 7.62 round offers exceptional armour penetration at the cost of moderate recoil."
  STR_MACHINEGUN_UFOPEDIA: "A high-powered machinegun that fires 9x39mm rounds, and features an advanced recoil absorption system for improved accuracy during sustained fire. The small Soviet round is selected for its light weight and rapid re-fire time, improving ability to rapidly deal a lot of damage."
  STR_SHOTGUN_UFOPEDIA: "This military shotgun fires 12-gauge buckshot shells containing enough power to kill a buck. It is not good for penetrating armour, but rather is best used on tough, fleshy targets. Due to the way the pellets spread out in flight, the shotgun does not lose accuracy due to range so much as it loses power due to range."
  STR_HEAVY_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "The heavy cannon is a devastating but cumbersome weapon. Its versatility comes from the fact that it can take three types of ammunition. The powerful AP shells have extreme armour penetration capability."
  STR_AUTO_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: "The auto-cannon combines the versatility and overall power of a heavy cannon with a fast fire rate. This weapon is impressively powerful when the trigger is held down for sustained fire."

  STR_PLASMA_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: "The Plasma Pistol is a powerful and sleek alien weapon based on accelerating particles from within a minute anti-gravity field. Our soldiers cannot operate this weapon because it is locked in such a way that its operator must have a special psionic link with the weapon."
  STR_PLASMA_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: "The Plasma Rifle is a powerful and accurate alien weapon based on accelerating particles from within a minute anti-gravity field. Our soldiers cannot operate this weapon because it is locked in such a way that its operator must have a special psionic link with the weapon."
  STR_HEAVY_PLASMA_UFOPEDIA: "The Heavy Plasma is a cumbersome yet exceedingly powerful alien weapon based on accelerating particles from within a minute anti-gravity field. Our soldiers cannot operate this weapon because it is locked in such a way that its operator must have a special psionic link with the weapon."
  STR_PLASMA_PISTOL_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: "This is a power source for the small alien Plasma Pistol. It is comprised of hypercapacitors which store electromagnetic energy contained within a self-reinforcing power field."

  STR_PLASMA_ASSAULT_CANNON_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: "Ammo clip designed for the Plasma Assault Cannon."
  STR_PLASMA_SHOTGUN_UFOPEDIA: "The Plasma Shotgun is simpler than alien weapons, able to produce plasma and fire it through a magnetic confinement beam, but without the production of gravity waves from Elerium-115. Therefore the plasma projectile rapidly expands as it leaves the weapon."
  STR_PLASMA_SHOTGUN_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: "Ammo clip designed for the Plasma Shotgun.{NEWLINE}Alien plasma weaponry is made of long chains of identical chambers, each of which handles a central channel of plasma as well as an electromagnetic conduit around the outside which generates the power fields that contain the plasma.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Alien plasma weapons fire a tiny ball of plasma that is over a million degrees Celsius and is thousands of times the density of water. In order to keep the plasma ball from coming apart, it is charged with gravity waves produced by Elerium-115 and then channelled through a magnetic confinement beam emitted by the weapon. We are far from being able to fully reproduce this technology, however we can salvage components from alien weapons to produce our own plasma weaponry. This technology far surpasses our own."
  STR_BLASTER_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "This is an alien guided missile launcher which fires powerful 'blaster bombs' that can follow waypoints to hit targets around corners. Our soldiers cannot operate this weapon as it is psionically locked, however further study may crack this locking mechanism."
  STR_BLASTER_BOMB_UFOPEDIA: "This device is a precision demolition tool that has an intelligent guidance system. It produces an immensely strong blast confined to a strangely small zone. It is fired from an Alien Blaster Launcher."
  STR_SMALL_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "A small one-hand launcher which fires stun bombs, enabling the aliens to capture live specimens. Our soldiers cannot operate this weapon as it is psionically locked, however further study may crack this locking mechanism."
  STR_STUN_BOMB_UFOPEDIA: "The Stun Bomb is used for capturing live human specimens. Upon impact, the bomb releases a shock wave which paralyzes targets caught within the blast. It is fired from an Alien Small Launcher."
  STR_BLASTER_LAUNCHER_TERRAN_UFOPEDIA: "An adaptation of the alien smart bomb launcher which can be used by our soldiers. It fires guided missiles that can follow waypoints as directed by the user."
  STR_SMALL_LAUNCHER_TERRAN_UFOPEDIA: "An adaptation of the alien stun launcher which can be used by our soldiers. It fires small yet powerful bombs, of which we can develop several different types."
  STR_BLASTER_BOMB_TERRAN_UFOPEDIA: "This sophisticated missile is guided to the target, where it detonates and uses a confinement field to minimise the blast area, delivering tremendous damage to a small zone. It is fired from a Blaster Launcher."
  STR_BLASTER_HE_BOMB_UFOPEDIA: "We can combine basic alien explosive technology with this alien weapon. This ammunition carries a high-explosive charge which produces a weaker explosion but a larger blast radius."

  STR_STUN_BOMB_TERRAN_UFOPEDIA: "The paralytic Stun Bomb is great for stunning virtually any living target, including most alien races. We can use this to easily capture them alive. It is fired from a Small Launcher."
  STR_INCENDIARY_BOMB_UFOPEDIA: "We can combine our own incendiary technology with this alien weapon. This ammunition carries a thermite incendiary charge."
  STR_HE_BOMB_UFOPEDIA: "We can combine alien explosive technology with this alien weapon. This ammunition carries a high-explosive charge."
  STR_SMOKE_BOMB_UFOPEDIA: "We can combine our own smoke technology with this alien weapon. This ammunition releases a thick cloud of smoke on impact."
  STR_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "This fragmentation grenade is a very portable yet very powerful weapon. To use it, first prime the grenade and then throw it to the target. Once the soldier has released the primed grenade, it will detonate within a few seconds."
  STR_SMOKE_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "Smoke grenades are useful for providing cover in exposed combat situations. Use with care because they can benefit the enemy as well. To use the smoke grenade, prime it like an ordinary grenade, then throw it into an open area which you would like to blanket with a smokescreen."
  STR_ALIEN_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "This device works in the same way as a terrestrial grenade, except that it is lighter and more powerful. This weapon is relatively weaker than other weapons employed by the aliens, demonstrating a preference for portability and ease of use over sheer power. The grenade is locked and refuses to be operated by our agents. We will not be able to employ them in combat until we can defeat this lock."
  STR_PROXIMITY_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "A proximity mine can be thrown like an ordinary grenade but is triggered by nearby movement after it lands. Great skill and care is required to use these devices properly."
  STR_AE_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "Having circumvented the psionic locking mechanism on the device, we can now employ the aliens' hand grenades against them. The aliens' grenades are significantly more powerful than ours, but are also considerably lighter. A soldier can throw one of these grenades a lot farther than they can throw a normal grenade."
  STR_AE_PROXIMITY_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "This proximity mine combines the alien's explosive technology with our own proximity detonation sensors. It is like a normal proximity mine, except that it is lighter and more powerful."
  STR_AE_HIGH_EXPLOSIVE_UFOPEDIA: "This weapon is a powerful explosive charge capable of destroying any target or even breaching UFO walls. Use with extreme caution."
  STR_FUSION_HIGH_EXPLOSIVE_UFOPEDIA: "This device contains an amped-up fusion charge which delivers enormous destructive power across a moderately large blast radius."
  STR_STUN_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "We can transform the alien's stun ammunition into a simple grenade, slightly increasing its power while also enabling it to be used without a launcher."
  STR_STUN_PROXIMITY_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "Our proximity mine technology can easily be adapted to hold an alternative type of explosive charge, such as the alien's stun ammunition."
  STR_INCENDIARY_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "A thermite incendiary charge which blankets an area in extremely hot material."
  STR_ELECTRO_FLARE_UFOPEDIA: "This compact device produces a bright flare light when it is thrown. This will highlight enemy units in the vicinity of the electro-flare during night time missions.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The small electro-flare produces light over a smaller area, and is useful during covert operations to light up a specific area but keep everything around it shrouded in darkness. It is also vulnerable to explosives, and can be remotely removed from the battlefield."
  STR_ELECTRO_FLARE_LARGE_UFOPEDIA: "This compact device produces a bright flare light when it is thrown. This will highlight enemy units in the vicinity of the electro-flare during night time missions.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The large electro-flare produces an especially bright light, blanketing a significant area in light.

  STR_ALIEN_RESEARCH_UFOPEDIA: "The alien research mission is used for collecting basic data on earth and its inhabitants. Small vehicles are predominantly used, with occasional landings in deserted areas. This type of alien activity poses the least threat to X-Com, with little concern from governments or the public."
  STR_ALIEN_HARVEST_UFOPEDIA: "The aliens have many uses for earth's fauna. Animals are abducted secretly, and returned with various organs removed. Cattle mutilations are predominantly reported along with UFO sightings. This type of alien activity causes great concern for governments and considerable anxiety amongst the population. This type of activity occurs mainly in farming land. The theory behind the 'alien harvest' suggests that alien races originally 'seeded' the planet with its flora and fauna, and now they have returned to reap the harvest they have sown."
  STR_ALIEN_ABDUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "This is the most insidious form of alien activity. The abduction by aliens is widely reported, despite the aliens' attempts to erase the experience from their victims' memories. Abductees report being subject to humiliating physical examinations, including impregnation of alien foetuses and bizarre genetic experiments. The purpose behind this activity appears to be linked to genetic mutation and manipulation of the aliens' own genetic material. This activity causes great alarm, and occurs in populated areas or cities."
  STR_ALIEN_INFILTRATION_UFOPEDIA: "Earth governments can be infiltrated by alien agents which are human in appearance. This can result in official contact between aliens and governments at the highest level. The climax of this activity is characterised by intense UFO activity in the vicinity of major cities. The aliens will attempt to sign a pact with an earth government by offering knowledge of their superior technology. In return the government will allow the aliens to conduct their activity unhindered. This alien mission represents the worst threat to X-Com. If a government agrees to a pact then its funding will cease."
  STR_ALIEN_TERROR_UFOPEDIA: "When the aliens terrorise a city they will deploy some special forces with awesome powers. Civilians will be directly threatened, and governments will be forced to evacuate whole areas. The main purpose behind this activity is to generate sufficient public hysteria so that governments will threaten the X-Com project."
  STR_ALIEN_RETALIATION_UFOPEDIA: "If X-Com interceptors are being particularly successful in shooting down UFOs then the aliens may take some retaliatory action. This could result in a direct attack against an X-Com base. However, the aliens have to find an X-Com base in order to attack it, and provided UFOs are kept away then there should be little danger of an assault."
  STR_ALIEN_SUPPLY_UFOPEDIA: "Once an alien base is constructed then it is resupplied on a regular basis by a special supply vessel. If one of these vessels is detected while landing then it is probable that an alien base is nearby."
# Alien craft refire times are the median value between the base value in Veteran difficulty (base minus 8) and the base value in Genius difficulty (base minus 12). Thus the final value listed here is base value minus 10.

  STR_COVERT_OPS_DATA_SHIP_UFOPEDIA: "The covert ops ship is fast and well-armed for its size. Its crew is a small mix of soldiers and navigators, making it an ideal target for the recovery of mind probes. The craft is equipped with a compact plasma system, full-size navigation system, and two small power sources. All larger craft also contain standard navigation systems but the covert ops ship's navigation system is uniquely likely to survive a crash."
  STR_MEDIUM_SCOUT_DATA_UFOPEDIA: "The medium scout is a vulnerable ship which carries a mix of soldiers and navigators. All larger vessels have some navigators, but this ship tends to have the most, so you can potentially find more mind probes on this ship than on any other. The craft is equipped with a fast-firing plasma system and a single full-size power source."
  STR_LARGE_SCOUT_DATA_UFOPEDIA: "The large scout is well-armed and able to be refitted into a wide variety of configurations. It serves as both scout ship as well as extended mission support or even defence vessel. The crew are mostly soldiers with at least one engineer present. This is a good target for recovering either alien grenades or heavy troop weaponry. The craft contains two power sources and a high-power plasma system."
  STR_CARGO_SHIP_DATA_UFOPEDIA: "The cargo ship is durable and lightly shielded, and while it is armed it is still one of the more vulnerable craft in the alien fleet. The crew roster are a variety of skilled types including navigators, engineers, and medics. No leaders are present. The craft is usually filled with food storage and other basic supplies for the aliens, along with three power sources, two shield emitters, and two plasma emitters. We can recover this craft for a high total amount of gains, with nothing particularly important inside."
  STR_HARVESTER_DATA_UFOPEDIA: "What the harvester lacks in weapons range it makes up for with weapon power. Long-range weaponry may be ideal against this tough opponent. There are several engineers on the crew roster, meaning this craft is a good source of heavy troop weaponry. There is also a single leader, which may be a psionic agent. It will always come equipped with laser surgical equipment for slicing cattle as well as food storage, and it has four power sources, three shield emitters, and two plasma emitters.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}There appears to be no tractor beam device within the ship, and it is unclear how it is able to levitate cattle."
  STR_ABDUCTOR_DATA_UFOPEDIA: "The abductor is the fastest alien craft of its size and one of the fastest in their fleet. It is also a tough opponent in combat. The crew consists of several medics which are equipped with the small alien launcher and carry stun ammo. There is also a single leader, which may be a psionic agent. Inside the craft there will always be operating tables on which they perform horrific human experiments, as well as their alien entertainment systems, four power sources, three shield emitters, and two plasma emitters.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}There appears to be no tractor beam device within the ship, and it is unclear how it is able to levitate its abductees."
  STR_TERROR_SHIP_DATA_UFOPEDIA: "The terror of the skies is powerful yet fast and evasive in demeanor. As difficult an opponent as it is, it appears the aliens fear for its safety nonetheless. These ships carry the largest array of terrorist units and are used to engage in coercive tactics against governments, or pure terrorism against civilians. The craft contains entertainment systems, five power sources, six shield emitters, and four plasma emitters."
  STR_SUPPLY_SHIP_DATA_UFOPEDIA: "This is one of the most durable ships in the alien fleet. It is exceptionally well shielded plus well-armed. These aren't as fast as several other alien craft, but they nonetheless try to avoid conflict. The crew roster is meager and fairly standard. There are no terrorists but there is one leader. Inside the craft there is lots of food storage, various supplies, six power sources, twelve shield emitters, and four plasma emitters. Ironically, perhaps, the extra defences on this ship make it an ideal target for capturing shield emitters."
  STR_BATTLESHIP_DATA_UFOPEDIA: "This huge craft is designed for mission support as well as combat. It is very well armed and shielded, very fast, and very dangerous. The crew roster contains all sorts, with a large number of soldiers in particular. It also contains a single commander, the highest-ranking alien, with a strong likelihood of having one or more psionic agents present. Recovering these will give us many supplies, including plenty of alien grenades. The craft contains a habitat section, plenty of fuel, ten power sources, sixteen shield emitters, eight plasma emitters, and can be refit for a variety of purposes."
  STR_MOTHERSHIP_DATA_UFOPEDIA: "This is the largest alien craft and is perhaps the definition of putting all of your eggs in one basket. This is a very durable and well-defended basket which contains virtually everything you'd ever find in an alien craft or base. The crew is enormous and contains all ranks. The craft is equipped with twelve power sources, twenty-six shield emitters, and eight plasma emitters."
  STR_PATROLLER_DATA_UFOPEDIA: "This tiny craft is very agile and evasive. It will not land during missions, instead it will patrol for X-Com craft. The recovery is not particularly exciting, but it does provide a navigator which will be carrying a mind probe, as well as a compact navigation system, two small power sources, and a plasma system."
  STR_LIGHT_DESTROYER_DATA_UFOPEDIA: "This small craft is very powerful for its size. Destroyers never land during missions, instead they exclusively patrol for X-Com craft. This is the smallest ship to come equipped with energy shields. Its crew contains soldiers and navigators, and sometimes a single terrorist. The craft carries food or entertainment, three power sources, one shield emitter, and two plasma emitters."
  STR_MEDIUM_DESTROYER_DATA_UFOPEDIA: "This is a very powerful and capable warship. It has a robust navigational and sensor array for scanning down X-Com craft. As such, it would be an excellent source of alien computers, if we could manage to assault one which had landed. Its crew is meager yet contains all ranks up through leader, including a few terrorists. The craft carries food or entertainment, five power sources, four shield emitters, four plasma emitters, and often carries a sizable amount of habitat or other useful components as well."
  STR_HEAVY_DESTROYER_DATA_UFOPEDIA: "The most devastating ship in the aliens' fleet is designed purely for the rigors of warfare. It has a strong sensor suite and can sense X-Com craft quite well. It is fast and deadly. The crew are varied across all ranks up through leader, including some terrorists. The craft carries both food and entertainment, eight power sources, nine shield emitters, and eight plasma emitters. Due to its power systems redundancy and hull reinforcement, this craft is particularly likely to have power sources and elerium which survive a crash."
  STR_TERROR_SITE_UP: "Terror Sites"
  STR_TERROR_SITE_UP_UFOPEDIA: "When the aliens terrorise a city, they erect a pyramid tower containing a beacon generator, creating a beacon which can be seen from kilometers away. Once the beacon is erected, an attack ensues, and any civilians found in the vicinity of the beacon are brutally slaughtered, and their mangled corpses left to rot. The beacon itself serves no direct function and the entire manoeuvre seems designed to make civilians fear the aliens. We can dismantle the beacon fairly easily with explosives, however assaulting or penetrating the pyramid may prove difficult and dangerous as it is often well guarded.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}If you are not prepared to face the aliens at the terror site, then you must at least disable the beacon. Our agents will then come in after the attack and clean up the mess. It is best if the people don't know about the aliens."
  STR_ALIEN_OUTPOST_UP: "Alien Outposts"
  STR_ALIEN_OUTPOST_UP_UFOPEDIA: "An alien outpost is a small base of operations which helps to fortify their position on Earth. These are cheap and can be built quickly. It is not a great loss to the aliens if we destroy these, yet nonetheless we should still get rid of them.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Assaulting an alien outpost is quite easy. They are small and not well defended. You can neutralize all aliens on site in order to collect the resources, however if you are not interested in looting the base, you can easily destroy its control center simply by detonating the fuel tanks in the room underneath it."
  STR_ALIEN_BASE_UP: "Alien Bases"
  STR_ALIEN_BASE_UP_UFOPEDIA: "An alien base is a large structure built for permanent habitation on Earth. These are well-equipped with supplies and manufacturing capability, and will be home to many aliens. Assaulting these is difficult and dangerous, as there will always be plenty of soldiers and terrorists present, and there will also be psionic agents among the alien forces at the base. However if you neutralize all aliens in the base, then you will lay claim to a treasure trove of resources, and you will be dealing a severe blow to the alien forces.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The alien command center is not easily assaulted, but it is easy enough to identify by the two concentric walls encasing the entrance room, themselves situated within a habitat section."

  STR_PSI_DEFENSE_ARMOR_UFOPEDIA: "WEIGHT: 30    This suit interfaces the soldier's mind directly to psionic interference circuitry, greatly enhancing their ability to resist psionic influence, though it may also inhibit their ability to perform psionic attacks.

  STR_UFO_PLASMA_EMITTER_UFOPEDIA: "This is an interface which bends the ship's gravity waves around hot plasma, producing a cohesive beam which it fires as a weapon. The expelled plasma travels at relativistic speeds and can maintain its cohesiveness through atmosphere out to several miles; in space its optimal range is hypothetically many times greater. It is a highly accurate weapon, comparable to our smart missiles in tracking ability, yet vastly superior in terms of power."
  STR_UFO_PLASMA_ARRAY_UFOPEDIA: "These conduits carry hot plasma from the power source, around the exterior of the alien craft, and to the plasma emitters where it gets expelled as a weapon. The long conduit length gives room for hot plasma to be stored briefly before firing. When the craft's weapon is preparing to fire, it will fill the conduits completely with plasma. When it fires, it will discharge all of the plasma at once. Some alien craft carry thick, high-capacity conduits to charge up for a powerful shot, while others carry multi-channel conduits which run alongside each other, allowing the weapon to charge multiple channels simultaneously so that it can fire rapidly like an autocannon."
  STR_UFO_SHIELD_EMITTER_UFOPEDIA: "This device directs the ship's gravity waves to deflect incoming attacks. It erects a plasma attraction field around the craft which causes any incoming attack to be deflected perfectly, at the cost of depleting the shield capacitors. Once fully depleted, the craft will no longer be protected, but the capacitors regenerate slowly over several hours.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The larger alien craft make heavy use of this shielding system, enabling them to easily withstand hits that otherwise should have completely demolished them."
  STR_ALIEN_FUEL_PODS_UFOPEDIA: "Alien power systems consume deuterium along with the element Elerium-115. These pods store liquid deuterium within a complex structure which prevents loss of deuterium. Normally, deuterium slowly escapes any container. We cannot reproduce this material yet fortunately we have no need for it. Any fuel ''shrinkage'' from containers of X-Com design will be paid for by the council."
  STR_ALIEN_POWER_ARRAYS_UFOPEDIA: "The power source of the alien craft contains an array of identical power generators, each of which can manipulate gravity waves in order to feed hydrogen fuel into the reaction chamber. In the reaction chamber, hydrogen is fused to generate intense heat and pressure, and this heat and pressure is further used to activate elerium to generate gravity waves, or to transform hydrogen gas into hot plasma. The system relies on heat and pressure in the reaction chamber in order to keep functioning. It has no on/off function and must be kept permanently active during missions."
  STR_ALIEN_COMPUTER_ARRAYS_UFOPEDIA: "This device is of alien design, and its function seems very similar to our own electronic computers. It is also an electronic device but its design is completely alien and is more similar to a biological brain than to any computer we've ever built. The computer module mostly contains recognizeable components, however it lacks transistors. Due to its complex microelectronic design and efficient pathways, it is generally faster than our computers at most tasks, although it is significantly less advanced than our computers overall.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Several of these computer modules can be strung together in an array to make a larger and more powerful computer, and the modules automatically arrange data storage and pathways in an efficient manner. We stand to learn as much about computer design from the aliens' computers as they stand to learn from ours."
  STR_ALIEN_WEAPON_COMPONENTS_UFOPEDIA: "Alien power and weapon systems and conduits use a lot of similar and redundant components repeatedly throughout each array. The design is roughly a system of plasma conduits and heat exchangers which can contain and deliver hot plasma under high pressure. This plasma can activate Elerium to produce gravity waves, and then be propelled out of an emitter either as a weapon or combined with hydrogen fuel to generate thrust. It can also be used to generate deuterium fusion. The highly redundant design suggests that only a small fraction of alien society draws up schematics for their technology, which is carefully designed to enable low-skilled operators to replicate and construct ships and equipment of high operational capacity. To that end, salvaging these components from the aliens is by far the easiest way to replicate their technology."
  STR_ALIEN_EXPLOSIVE_UNITS_UFOPEDIA: "Alien grenades primarily use a chemical reaction system just like our own explosive weaponry. The key difference is that they have small energy storage devices embedded within the explosive which upon detonation will release their energy. That energy will catalyse the primary explosive chemical to produce a more powerful and efficient explosion. Due to this, alien grenades are lighter and smaller than any explosive we can produce at the same yield. We are able to replicate the embedded energy storage devices, however it may be more efficient to just salvage them from alien grenades."
  STR_PSIONIC_FEEDBACK_DEVICE_UFOPEDIA: "This device can translate psionic waves to computer data, and forms the basis for all of the aliens' psionic technology. The device can receive input in the form of psionic waves and translate it into the ''data waves'' used by alien computers, or vice-versa. Every individual in the alien society has one of these implanted into their mind, and it is used to control everything they do. We can potentially hack this communications network to jam the signals or perhaps to send our own false signals."
  STR_PSIONIC_WAVE_DECODER_UFOPEDIA: "This is a data processing unit which can take computer data generated from psionic waves and translate the information into useful data. Alien equipment often uses these to track orders sent over the psionic network, mission details, data collected, and other minutiae relevant to the aliens' mission here on Earth. We can use these devices to spy on the aliens or perhaps even to understand how they think and how we can manipulate that for our purposes. The alien hive-like society seems ultimately vulnerable to exploitation via the use of their own communications network."
  STR_PSIONIC_WAVE_EMITTER_UFOPEDIA: "Alien psionic waves propagate through empty space and interact with matter, specifically by generating signals within the nervous systems of living creatures. This instrument is able to generate or amplify those psionic waves. These devices will be crucial for granting us the ability to take advantage of alien psionic power."
  STR_ANTI_GRAV_UNIT_UFOPEDIA: "This device was harvested from a flying alien and is a mechanical implant which gave the alien the ability to hover. The small device contains an energy battery and a small plasma chamber along with a very tiny bit of elerium. It can generate focused gravity waves for a little over an hour before becoming depleted, however it is easily recharged with alien plasma. Given the relatively small capacity in the device, it seems the aliens have little use in being away from their power systems for any extended period of time."
  STR_CYBERNETIC_SKELETON_LIGHT_UFOPEDIA: "This is a set of high-tech cybernetic and bionic components harvested from a cyberdisc. The system was integrated between the living flesh and the machinery of the cyborg. Like much of the alien technology, this system is highly redundant and can be repurposed potentially in many ways. Our use for it may be limited, but it will likely prove useful in replicating powerful battle machines such as what the aliens use against us."
  STR_CYBERNETIC_SKELETON_HEAVY_UFOPEDIA: "This is a set of high-tech cybernetic and bionic components harvested from a sectopod. The system was integrated between the living flesh and the machinery of the cyborg. This system is made of durable and robust components and can be repurposed into almost any shape. We may be able to put it to work toward making sturdy battle machines to use against the aliens."
  STR_ALIEN_LASER_UFOPEDIA: "The aliens' laser design matches the design of a laser system recovered from an alien spacecraft decades ago, confirming that that craft likely belonged to the same aliens who terrorise us today.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The basic design of the laser is similar to our lasers, but the critical difference is in the power conduit which operates the laser. It accepts extremely hot plasma and transforms it into a tremendous energy differential, converting the heat into high-intensity light and returning cool hydrogen gas to the plasma generator. The focusing medium is put under heat and pressure in order to calibrate its dynamics differently at different power levels, producing a cohesive beam ranging from extremely low to extremely high power levels. This laser can easily make precision cuts through virtually any material, and the small and lightweight power conduit can store enough energy to fire the beam on full power for several minutes."
  STR_ALIEN_SURGICAL_INTERFACE_UFOPEDIA: "This is a somewhat rudimentary data processing system which apparently stores information on all of the biological and genetic makeup of a wide variety of creatures. It directs alien surgical equipment during use, making complex operations easy for a low-skilled user. We can use these systems to perform rapid and high-precision laser surgery on people and animals. We cannot yet retrieve any useful data from the device, as the aliens' data language is indecipherable to us. In the years to come, we can almost certainly replicate and even outperform these systems; however until we crack the alien language we will have to stick to salvaging these systems from alien craft."
  STR_ALIEN_GENETIC_IMPLANTER_UFOPEDIA: "This tool has a set of microscopic instruments, duplicated dozens of times over, on the end of each of several small needles. We are a long way from understanding the complex workings of the instrument, but we know that its function is to implant genetic material directly into living tissue. The machine operates at high speed and can genetically transform an entire living creature in a matter of hours.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The aliens use these devices to genetically alter their test subjects through many gradual transformations, ultimately seeking to perfect the creature's form for eventual enslavement."
  STR_MUTON_ARMOR_GRAFTS_UFOPEDIA: "Mutons have a complex organoplastic merged with their skin. They are not born with it and it does not grow on them naturally, rather it is surgically applied and the skin of the muton merges with the material. The complex material replicates various skin functions such as pores and blood circulation while providing a tough and flexible armour shell on the muton. The material can be grown and repaired easily by immersing a small sample of the material into an aqueous solution containing the necessary compounds, poured into a mould to form the desired shape.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The material is rigid at rest, but receives signals from the Muton's body prior to movement, and the armour shell adjusts its microscopic structure to enable the anticipated movement."
  STR_VENOM_GLAND_UFOPEDIA: "This strange organ was removed from a celatid. It is a gland which produces and contains the celatid's venom, a highly corrosive mixture of proteins and enzymes which produces the effects of multiple acids, bases, and solvents simultaneously, making the substance able to attack virtually any material. It can eat through metal or flesh as easily as water eats through dirt.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The enzyme can be preserved inside the venom sac seemingly indefinitely, under the right conditions. We can potentially weaponise this venom, but it will require further study in alien weapons technology. For now, we can store any venom glands which we collect on the battlefield."

  STR_RESEARCH_ADVICE_UFOPEDIA: "Welcome to the X-Com Project, Commander.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}In this section of the UFOPedia you will find documents detailing preliminary examinations which our agents have made on various technological avenues. This information can be valuable to you in selecting projects to spend the time and resources to research. We wish to make your job as easy as possible, Commander.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}As you are taking the time to read this, we feel it prudent to alert you to one of the more promising leads we have thus far. An alien craft recovered decades ago contained powerful laser equipment, however we were unable to utilise the tech due to insufficient power systems capability. The alien craft's power systems were destroyed in the crash. You may be able to revive, complete, and weaponise this project, if you can capture a fresh power system from the aliens so that we can study it."
  STR_DAMAGE_ADVICE_UFOPEDIA: "ARMOUR PIERCING: This ammo type is good for getting past armour. Be mindful of your target's toughness. A sufficiently thick shell of armour may be impervious to small AP ammo yet highly vulnerable to large AP rounds.{NEWLINE}HIGH EXPLOSIVE: Increases chance to hit target. Also useful for clearing obstacles. A larger target can take more damage from explosive ammo if its armour isn't too strong. To destroy a large armoured target, use a powerful explosive.{NEWLINE}INCENDIARY: Thermite charges deal damage over time and can deal damage right past armour. Incendiary is particularly useful against large targets, and it can also provide light at night.{NEWLINE}SMOKE: Smoke charges deal no damage but instead provide cover by obscuring vision. Place your snipers under cover of smoke, and have your rangers or tanks move forward to act as spotters.{NEWLINE}PLASMA: Our intelligence division reports that the aliens are armed with superheated plasma which melts through flesh or steel equally well. We should be very careful around these astonishingly powerful weapons."
  STR_DAMAGE_ADVICE_ADVANCED_UFOPEDIA: "LASER: In addition to being very powerful and accurate, lasers are good against every alien we have encountered. They seem to have no resistance to this weapon.{NEWLINE}PLASMA: The aliens' weapon of choice is able to chew through almost any armour, even the aliens' own armour and craft hulls. However, reports indicate that a small number of alien types wear a special armour which is resistant to their own plasma. Perhaps these foes can be killed with lasers instead.{NEWLINE}STUN: The small alien launcher is used to incapacitate humans and cattle without killing them. We can use this effectively against most aliens, even the mechanical ones because they have integrated flesh and it can be stunned.{NEWLINE}ACID: The mutons sometimes travel with a small companion which has a weapon designed to destroy armour. They employ such creatures when they have abandoned their desire to conquer, and only wish to destroy the living. The best defence against their acid spit is to avoid being shot."
  STR_WEAPON_ADVICE_UFOPEDIA: "PISTOLS: Small, one-handed weapons which can be handled along with other equipment, such as a motion scanner or medi-kit. These are fast firing and ideal for agile soldiers.{NEWLINE}RIFLES: Accurate marksmanship weapons, great for longer range shots. Rifles are particularly good for aimed shots.{NEWLINE}HEAVY WEAPONS: Cumbersome but hard-hitting. These are best used by strong soldiers to penetrate heavy armour.{NEWLINE}LAUNCHERS: Single-shot weapons which may deal the highest damage but are the most cumbersome weapons. These are best saved to be used on the toughest enemies.{NEWLINE}SEMI-AUTO: Slower-firing weapons which deal a lot more damage per hit. These weapons are ideal for piercing armour.{NEWLINE}AUTOMATIC: Fast-firing weapons. These weapons deal heavy damage to low-armour targets, and they make up for their poor accuracy by getting a lot of chances to hit.{NEWLINE}GRENADE: Portable yet powerful single-use weapon which can be thrown over obstacles. Especially useful against groups of enemies. A group of soldiers is also known as a grenade magnet."
  STR_PSIONIC_ARMOR_ADVICE_UFOPEDIA_1: "Choosing an optimal armour suit to wear against powerful alien forces has a lot to do with psionic potential, and balancing psionic attack versus psionic defence. If your soldiers have high psionic defence, it will protect them from alien wizards. However, with high psionic attack, your soldiers can dominate all lesser minds on the field, reducing exposure to many other forms of attack.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}On the next page, each of the five psionic armour suits are ranked in terms of psionic defence or attack potential. Note that the civilian-made Psionic Alloy Armour dominates in terms of overall psionic potential. It has inferior attributes in other areas, but we should consider it to be a possible option for equipping our soldiers. Its other advantage is its low price. The integrated armour suits are quite possibly the best across the board, but also are highly expensive.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}      ARMOUR COMPARISON ON NEXT PAGE ===>"

We cannot yet replicate the weapons that the aliens use, but we can produce laser weapons which will nonetheless be much more potent than what we're already using. Laser weapons would be slow firing because they must dissipate heat, but they will be highly accurate.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}At first we will focus on developing basic infantry lasers, but once we have mastered this technology, we will be able to build powerful laser weapons for many applications.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}LASER WEAPONS: Laser Pistol, Laser Rifle, Tank Laser Cannon, Craft Light Laser{NEWLINE}HEAVY LASERS: Heavy Laser, Assault Tank Laser, Craft Laser{NEWLINE}AUTOMATIC LASERS: Handheld Automatics, Craft Pulse Cannon"
  STR_PLASMA_PRELIMINARY_UFOPEDIA: "DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Studying the aliens' plasma weaponry reveals that it is very complex and relies on several technological advancements we do not yet understand. The weapons use a psionic locking mechanism which prevents any unauthorised use. If there is to be any hope for us to take advantage of this weaponry, we must find some way to capture and interrogate an alien engineer. We will also need to study alien power systems and explore more high energy weapons research. We must discover the secrets of operating these weapons."
  STR_PLASMA_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: "DIFFICULTY: HARD{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The alien engineer was coerced into yielding data on the important functions of the alien's plasma weaponry, thus we have come to better understand the principles of their design. We will not be able to fully replicate these weapons with the same level of expertise as the aliens' original designs, but we can certainly 'optimise' their weapons to be usable by a human. We should also be able to replicate the technology at a larger scale, to make our own plasma weapons."
  STR_TRACTOR_BEAMS_UFOPEDIA: "DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Alien craft can travel much faster than our craft can. They do this by generating special energy fields around their craft which act as a lubricant for the atmosphere, enabling them to fly at high speed with very little resistance. The larger their craft, the greater the effect. There is little we will be able to do to match their speed until we can design craft using their technology.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Until then, we can at least use their own energy fields against them. A tractor beam would be a directed field generator, using the aliens' own shield generators, which would tug on their ship and force it to slow down.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}We would sneak up on a UFO which is moving slow, engage it in combat, and it would be unable to flee from us."
  STR_GUARDIAN_AND_ASSAULT_TANKS_UFOPEDIA: "DIFFICULTY: EASY{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Our tanks initially come in only one size, a hardy battle machine with strong armour and a powerful weapon.

We can also work with civilian companies to order tanks of custom design.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}GUARDIAN TANK: An especially sturdy tank with very heavy armour but a smaller weapon. This tank type would be invaluable for drawing fire away from vulnerable troops.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}ASSAULT TANK: A fast-moving light tank with a very powerful weapon. This tank type would be invaluable for penetrating the heaviest armour."
  STR_UFO_COMPONENTS_UFOPEDIA: "DIFFICULTY: MEDIUM{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Intelligence reports tell us that alien spacecraft are made of very lightweight and durable materials. They clearly use very advanced propulsion methods but as yet we have very little information on alien propulsion technology. It is vitally important that we capture and study the aliens' power systems, navigational computers, hull materials, and any fuel source they might be using. Studying this advanced technology will undoubtedly lead to vast improvements in our ability to combat the alien menace.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}We should also pay attention for any other components that might be useful to our research. The alien craft likely contain many useful technologies which we would want to study."
  STR_ALIEN_AUTOPSIES_UFOPEDIA: "DIFFICULTY: VERY EASY TO EASY{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Some limited amount of study of alien bodies has already been performed on some captive specimens before X-Com was formed. We don't know very much about them yet, but they are life as we know it, complete with recognisable organs. Studying their bodies should be easy, and we can glean plenty of useful information about them such as their combat weaknesses and strengths, clues about their behavior, and more that we simply cannot speculate on thus far."
  STR_ALIEN_INTERROGATION_UFOPEDIA: "DIFFICULTY: EASY TO MEDIUM{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}It will be very tricky to coerce information out of beings who don't speak any language that we can recognise, especially since none of them exhibit any drive for self-preservation when in captivity. So in order to pry into their minds, our scientists have developed a program which will attempt to manipulate the alien captives, monitor how they react to situations, and glean information in that way. Through managing their stress levels and altering their environments, we can begin to peer beneath their blank facade and see into their true nature."

They are most assuredly hostile, and carry small handheld weapons of enormous power, easily capable of killing a human in a single shot, even being able to blast through walls and armoured vehicles or structures. They seem to rely on these small weapons for combat, while they mostly try to remain secluded. We do not know their true intentions, but they seem unwilling to be discovered. Sectoids have excellent night vision and often operate under cover of darkness.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Beware, Commander, for we believe there to be several more alien races among their population."
  STR_CYBERDISC_BATTLEREPORT: "Cyberdisc: Scout Report"
  STR_CYBERDISC_BATTLEFIELD_REPORT: "While Sectoids usually operate alone, they have been seen accompanied by these Cyberdiscs, apparently large flying machines built for warfare. When the Sectoids attacked one of our cities, they brought these Cyberdiscs along to assist in causing damage. The Cyberdisc is an efficient killing machine, with an exceedingly powerful and accurate weapon. It is easily capable of leveling structures, though it seems to prefer killing humans. These powerful discs are heavily armoured and won't go down easily. If we ever manage to recover a disabled Cyberdisc, we should research it in order to determine its weaknesses. Until then, the Intelligence division recommends either heavy armour piercing weapons or powerful explosive rockets."
  STR_FLOATER_BATTLEREPORT: "Floater: Scout Report"
  STR_FLOATER_BATTLEFIELD_REPORT: "The second alien race to be identified are purple, vaguely humanoid beasts with horns, an empty torso, and the ability to fly in the air. Floaters are unarmoured and, while they have a firmer build than Sectoids, they may be less threatening overall since their reflexes and accuracy are less than that of a Sectoid. However, their ability to fly can enable them to ambush our troops from almost any angle.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The Floaters' eyes are small and appear designed to hunt prey in the daytime. It is likely that they have poor night vision. However should you choose to encounter them at night, Commander, you do so at your own discretion."
  STR_REAPER_BATTLEREPORT: "Reaper: Scout Report"
  STR_REAPER_BATTLEFIELD_REPORT: "Floaters have been seen employing these large beasts, Reapers, which have only two legs, no arms, and a vicious bite. We watched, helplessly, as they chewed through human bones with ease. Reapers are very fast-moving, lightly armoured, and have an impressive constitution. They likely won't go down easily with our current arsenal. Intelligence division tentatively suggests combatting them with armoured tanks and explosive weaponry. Just be careful not to cause more damage than you prevent, Commander."
  STR_SNAKEMAN_BATTLEREPORT: "Snakeman: Scout Report"
  STR_SNAKEMAN_BATTLEFIELD_REPORT: "Our agents have observed another alien race, the Snakemen, vaguely humanoid up top but with a prehensile abdominal section and no legs. The Snakemen have been observed performing menial tasks toward the aliens' sinister ends. These creatures do not wear any conventional armour, however they are very durable and are not easily killed. They bear wicked fangs and may be able to produce a venomous bite. Approach with caution. Intelligence division recommends using new weapons technology against these tough creatures. Our old weapons may not be effective."
  STR_CHRYSSALID_BATTLEREPORT: "Chryssalid: Scout Report"
  STR_CHRYSSALID_BATTLEFIELD_REPORT: "Chryssalids are arthropoidal creatures with a hard exoskeleton and extraordinarily fast movement speed. The Snakemen brought them along for terrorism, and what they did was far worse than kill people. Instead, these monsters turned people into walking zombies which later hatched into new Chryssalids. These creatures of terror are quite possibly the greatest threat we've seen the aliens bring to the table thus far. Intelligence division suggests we avoid putting our soldiers at risk when Chryssalids are present, and instead use tanks to fight them. Further research may reveal new tactics which we can use to gain the upper hand against these fearsome creatures."
  STR_MUTON_BATTLEREPORT: "Muton: Scout Report"
  STR_MUTON_BATTLEFIELD_REPORT: "Our agents have discovered another alien race, the Mutons, which appear to be some form of elite soldiers. Whereas previous aliens were primarily operatives preferring to labour in secrecy, the Mutons appear designed entirely for combat. The aliens may be preparing to mount an invasion against us.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Mutons are large, muscular, and hardy humanoids seemingly skilled in combat and possessing deadly aim. They don't appear to wear armour, yet they shrug off most attacks easily. We must prepare our best weapons if we're to stand a chance against this coming army."
  STR_CELATID_BATTLEREPORT: "Celatid: Scout Report"
  STR_CELATID_BATTLEFIELD_REPORT: "The Celatid is a small, hovering creature with no limbs or apparent sensory organs, which has been seen in the presence of Mutons. It is unknown how they sense other creatures, yet they spit some sort of destructive saliva with impressive accuracy. It is also unknown how deadly these creatures are, so approach them with caution. One of these would certainly be a valuable research specimen. Intelligence division suggests that their greatest weakness may be low ceilings. As for how to penetrate their tough skin, the usual tactics may apply here: try shooting them down, and if that doesn't work, research a dead one at the lab."
  STR_SILACOID_BATTLEREPORT: "Silacoid: Scout Report"
  STR_SILACOID_BATTLEFIELD_REPORT: "Silacoids are small blob-like creatures with no limbs or apparent sensory organs, which have been seen in the presence of Mutons. We don't know how their senses work, but they are fast, sturdy, and dangerous creatures which move up close to attack. It is difficult to discern their purpose or their capabilities from observing them, however we can tell that they are significantly armoured. Intelligence division suggests using armour piercing weapons against them. Due to the trail of fire they leave behind them, they appear to be very hot and are thus likely to resist any sort of heat-based attacks."
  STR_ETHEREAL_BATTLEREPORT: "Ethereal: Scout Report"
  STR_ETHEREAL_BATTLEFIELD_REPORT: "A new and enigmatic alien race has been sighted. The Ethereals wear robes disguising their true form. They can fly in the air with ease, and appear to be secret operatives possibly putting to work the machinations of a greater intelligence. These secretive beings are probably just as hostile as any other aliens, but their capabilities are unknown. Be advised to meet them with extreme prejudice, because all of the scouts we have sent to investigate the Ethereals have not returned, and we were unable to collect any information about the Ethereals' combat capabilities. They are probably extremely powerful and intelligent. Do not steer clear of them, Commander, for as much danger as they present to your troops, they surely present a greater danger to our entire species."
  STR_SECTOPOD_BATTLEREPORT: "Sectopod: Scout Report"
  STR_SECTOPOD_BATTLEFIELD_REPORT: "The Ethereals have brought Sectopods along for their terror attacks. The Sectopod appears to be a powerful battle robot armed with a laser weapon. It is designed less for destructive power and more for sturdiness. It has extremely strong armour, and most weapons are completely ineffective against these fearsome opponents. We must find a way to kill one and retrieve it for study. A weakness must be found, or else the aliens may be able to combat us with impunity."
  STR_SECTOID_UFOPEDIA: "The Sectoid hierarchy ranges from soldiers to leaders with powerful psionic abilities. These psionic powers can be used to demoralise soldiers in combat. They tend to indulge in human abductions and cattle mutilation. The abduction is used to extract genetic material for cross breeding and developing clones for infiltrating human society. The cattle provide both nutrition and genetic material. This race appears to want to develop superior genetic hybrids to increase the efficiency of their hive-like society."
  STR_SECTOID_AUTOPSY: "Sectoid autopsy"
  STR_SECTOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The autopsy reveals vestigial digestive organs and a simple structure. The brain and eyes are very well developed. The structure suggests genetic alteration or mutation. The small mouth and nose appear to have little function. The webbing between the fingers, and the flat feet suggest aquatic origins. There are no reproductive organs, and no clues as to how this species can reproduce. They are most probably a genetically engineered species."
  STR_CYBERDISC_UFOPEDIA: "This miniature flying saucer is an automated terror weapon armed with an immensely powerful plasma beam. The anti-gravity propulsion gives it a big advantage in difficult terrain. The Cyberdisc is the most destructive terror weapon in the alien army. Its primary function is destruction and terror in the service of the Sectoid race."
  STR_CYBERDISC_AUTOPSY: "Cyberdisc autopsy"
  STR_CYBERDISC_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The Cyberdisc is well shielded and is very good at withstanding most forms of attack, in particular explosive ammunition. It is vulnerable to heavy weaponry. Its sensors grant it impressive accuracy and it is able to spot targets easily at night or even through smoke. The primary anti-gravity system operates on principles we cannot yet understand. The self-destruct mechanism can be subverted with explosives, incendiary, or blunt force trauma, and once subverted we can salvage broken Cyberdiscs for several useful components."
  STR_FLOATER_UFOPEDIA: "The Floaters are primarily soldiers and technical operatives. They are naturally predatory beasts, genetically engineered and cybernetically enhanced to make versatile slaves. The lower half of the body and most internal organs are surgically removed, and a life support system is installed. This implant contains an anti-gravity unit which enables the creature to float, albeit unsteadily, through the air."
  STR_FLOATER_AUTOPSY: "Floater autopsy"
  STR_FLOATER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The creature has been drastically altered by surgery. The device which seems to form the core of the body is a life support system, taking over the function of heart, lungs and digestive system. This would enable the creature to survive in extremely hostile environments. The brain is smaller than ours, but the sensory organs are well developed. Its eyes seem designed to operate in the daytime on a planet much dimmer than ours. They don't see particularly well at night, but they do see better than we do. We can salvage the intact anti-gravity unit."
  STR_REAPER_UFOPEDIA: "This bipedal carnivore has powerful jaws and a voracious appetite. It has a number of brain implants which are used to control its activity. The primitive predatory instincts of this creature are of little use except to terrorise and destroy. Reapers are commonly associated with Floaters."
  STR_REAPER_AUTOPSY: "Reaper autopsy"
  STR_REAPER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The Reaper contains two 'brains' and two 'hearts' which allow it to function even when heavily wounded. However, its furry skin is highly flammable, making the creature vulnerable to incendiary weapons. It is also vulnerable to explosive weapons, due to its large size and lack of strong armor. Its night vision is poorer than some aliens yet still much better than ours."
  STR_SNAKEMAN_UFOPEDIA: "This race developed in an exceptionally hostile environment. They are hardy and can resist extreme temperature variations. Their mobility depends on a snake-like giant 'foot' which protects all the vital organs. If approached, they will attack with extremely sharp fangs, injecting a potent venom. While fairly intelligent, their objectives appear to be purely predatory and they appear to be under the command of some other intelligence which directs their military-style incursions on earth."
  STR_SNAKEMAN_AUTOPSY: "Snakeman autopsy"
  STR_SNAKEMAN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The skin is extremely tough and heat resistant. The cardio-vascular system is part of the muscular system which uses the hydraulic principle to create motion. The only true muscle is the 'heart'. Their fangs are a metal implant able to penetrate armor, and their venom is a potent hemotoxin but not scientifically useful. The reproductive system appears to be very efficient. Reproduction is asexual, with each snakeman carrying up to fifty eggs inside its body at any one time. Left to its own devices this species would be a severe threat to life on earth."
  STR_CHRYSSALID_UFOPEDIA: "The crab-like claws of this creature are a powerful weapon in close combat. The high metabolism and strength of this creature give it speed and dexterity. Instead of killing its victim it impregnates it with an egg and injects a venom which turns it into a walking zombie. A new Chryssalid will burst from the victim shortly after impregnation. Chryssalids are associated with the Snakeman race."
  STR_CHRYSSALID_AUTOPSY: "Chryssalid autopsy"
  STR_CHRYSSALID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The exoskeleton of this creature is extremely tough, but surprisingly vulnerable to explosive ammunition. The brain is well developed, and its cell growth rate very fast. The creature carries twenty eggs which are laid inside other organisms. This creature is a very effective terror weapon."
  STR_MUTON_UFOPEDIA: "This humanoid creature is physically powerful and intelligent. Their digestive system appears designed for eating raw flesh; however it is atrophied due to lack of use. They appear to rely on telepathic commands from a race known as 'Ethereals'. Once separated from this telepathic link their mental system appears to break down and they die. The cybernetic implants are used to enhance their combat performance. They are clearly the foot soldiers for a higher intelligence."
  STR_MUTON_AUTOPSY: "Muton autopsy"
  STR_MUTON_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The 'skin' of this creature appears to be an organically created protective armour which is grafted onto the body. There are numerous cybernetic implants which are used to enhance the cardiovascular system and the senses. The reproductive organs appear to have been surgically removed. Evidently these unfortunate creatures are limited to a life of warfare and conquest. Armour piercing ammunition is not very effective against their toughened skin. They are most easily dispatched with rapid-fire weapons."
  STR_CELATID_UFOPEDIA: "This life-form has the mysterious natural ability to float through the air. It appears to detect human brain waves and will move towards a human target even if well hidden. Once a target is detected the Celatid fires small globules of extremely corrosive venom. The creature has the ability to clone itself at an alarming rate. It accompanies the Muton race in its wanderings."
  STR_CELATID_AUTOPSY: "Celatid autopsy"
  STR_CELATID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The core contains a small bio-mechanical device which appears to be a naturally evolved anti-gravity propulsion system. The sac of venom is the largest organ and there does not appear to be a separate brain structure. There is no discernible digestive or reproductive system, however a small organ contains prepared embryos which can grow rapidly into a new being. The organs are marvelously self-sustaining and can be easily maintained separately within a nutrient solution. We can therefore salvage its organs for use in our manufacturing."
  STR_SILACOID_UFOPEDIA: "This silicon based life form generates an enormous amount of heat. It has the strength to crush rocks which can then be ingested by the hot core. It has a primitive intelligence and can be controlled by implants or telepathic beings. It can sense human brain waves and will instinctively move toward any human it senses nearby and attack. Silacoids work with the Muton alien race."
  STR_SILACOID_AUTOPSY: "Silacoid autopsy"
  STR_SILACOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The core of the creature is extremely hot, and seems to be the basis for a digestive system. Its unique muscle system has tremendous power and speed. Its rock-like skin is not harmed by fire or incendiary ammunition, but is vulnerable to explosives. Despite being armoured, it is not particularly vulnerable to armour-piercing ammunition."
  STR_ETHEREAL_UFOPEDIA: "This being has awesome mental powers which allow for telepathic communication and telekinetic abilities. The apparently weak physical abilities of this creature are sustained by its mental powers. We do not understand how these telekinetic powers work, since they seem to defy the laws of physics as we know them. They are extremely dangerous in any combat situation, where they rely on their mental powers for combat. They rarely appear on earth since they seem to rely on other races to pursue their objectives."
  STR_ETHEREAL_AUTOPSY: "Ethereal autopsy"
  STR_ETHEREAL_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This being is physically retarded and seems incapable of sustaining any life functions. The muscles are severely atrophied and the internal organs appear to be under-developed. The sensory organs, including the eyes, do not appear to function at all. The brain, however, is well developed and draws on a high proportion of the body's blood supply. It is a mystery as to how this creature can sustain itself without external support."
  STR_SECTOPOD_UFOPEDIA: "Sectopods are robot creatures with a powerful laser beam weapon and strong senses, being able to see perfectly at night or even through thick smoke. The control of these mechanical beasts is via a telepathic link to their controllers, the Ethereals. Sectopods are the most formidable terror weapon available to the alien forces."
  STR_SECTOPOD_AUTOPSY: "Sectopod autopsy"
  STR_SECTOPOD_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The robot is sturdily constructed with powered armour capable of resisting most forms of attack, in particular plasma weapons. However, the sensing circuitry seems particularly vulnerable to laser weapons. There are several useful components inside for us to salvage."
  STR_SNAKEMAN_COMMANDER_B_UFOPEDIA: "This queen does not lay eggs or take a reproductive role like a queen bee, rather it is more of a command locus which is able to exert psionic control over other snakemen that have been implanted. The queen can communicate psionically but does not appear to be intelligent. All of its communications are relegated to a singular operation of maintaining command connection with external alien command, and distributing that command to nearby snakemen."
  STR_SNAKEMAN_COMMANDER_B_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The queen of the snakeman colony is a creature containing the snakeman genome plus an additional genome. Its morphology suggests that it expresses genes from both genomes. Its body is much larger and more complex than a normal snakeman, but the most noteworthy difference is the lack of the massive reproductive system present in the smaller snakemen. The majority of the brain has been removed. The body structure and extensive array of implants suggest that the purpose of the queen is to regulate the snakeman colony, perhaps to keep the snakemen under control of the alien command structure."
  STR_MUTON_SOLDIER_B_UFOPEDIA: "This muton is stronger, faster, and tougher than the mutons we have encountered previously, and it has an enhanced capacity for waging war. It shows little restraint and is extremely hostile. These elite mutons do not live as long, and their bodies endure great stress from their activities."
  STR_MUTON_B_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This muton is unlike others we have encountered previously. It appears to have been surgically modified more than normal, with thicker armour grafts and a hormone delivery implant. This muton is a weapon of war, and it would seem that the aliens are adapting to our strategies."
  STR_ETHEREAL_NAVIGATOR_UFOPEDIA: "The Ethereal Navigator is a special coordinator beyond the navigators of other races. Normally, Ethereals' psionic connection subverts their need for navigators, however these are a special breed of Ethereal with an abnormally strong connection to their psionic network. These 'navigators' receive input directly from the central command located somewhere else in our solar system, and serve as a conduit which enables alien command to oversee operations on Earth directly. We should research more Ethereal Navigators if we get the chance, as they may shed valuable insight on the plans of the central alien command."
  STR_ETHEREAL_NAVIGATOR_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "This Ethereal has a much larger brain than the others; it seems to have been surgically altered to grow to this size. In particular, the psionic sensing center is vastly larger and contains many times the normal number of neural connections. We should capture a live Ethereal navigator, as we will undoubtedly uncover alien secrets from interrogating it."
  STR_ALIEN_SOLDIER_UFOPEDIA: "Soldiers are the military force of the alien onslaught. These beings are mindslaves of the alien command, and are raised from conception for no purpose other than to provide security or fight wars. The first one we interrogated has given us information on basic battle tactics as well as the use of their weaponry. All soldiers have the same training regimen, so we have no reason to believe any further study of soldiers will prove fruitful."
  STR_ALIEN_NAVIGATOR_UFOPEDIA: "Navigators are highly skillful members of the alien force who are well-versed in the minutiae of the aliens' strategic plans. Their purpose in the alien fleet is to keep track of events and coordinate actions as pertains to their mission. In studying more navigators, we can undoubtedly gain valuable insight into their greater strategies, which will help us to understand the aliens' actions and predict their next moves."
  STR_ALIEN_MEDIC_UFOPEDIA: "Alien medics are surgical specialists who contain knowledge of the anatomy of various races, and an understanding of how to alter their bodies to achieve various effects. Their work typically involves either making standardised surgical alterations to freshly-grown alien slaves, or experimenting on human abductees. The name we selected is ironic because their training involves almost nothing medicinal. Nonetheless, researching the alien medics may lead to breakthroughs in our own medical science."
  STR_ALIEN_ENGINEER_UFOPEDIA: "Engineers assist in the construction, employment, repair, and maintenance of equipment during field operations. As such they are well-versed in the technical details of much of their own equipment and craft. Most of what they know is trivial to us, but a small portion is extremely useful. The rest may yet be of strategic value."
  STR_ALIEN_LEADER_UFOPEDIA: "Alien Leaders are mid-ranking aliens who oversee mission operations. They carry orders direct from the alien central command, and oversee the execution of such orders. They also handle the slave aliens and ensure they remain on task. All alien races other than Ethereals are slaves."
  STR_ALIEN_COMMANDER_UFOPEDIA: "Alien commanders are the highest-ranking aliens you will ever see in the field. These aliens are surgically altered from their normal form to have a longer lifespan and grow a larger brain. They are more intelligent than the other aliens and oversee invasion operations on Earth at a larger scale.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Ethereal commanders represent one of the greatest threats to our world, as they are independent and intelligent elder Ethereals with astonishing psionic prowess. The Muton race does not have any commanders as they are deemed to lack the intelligence necessary for the job."
  STR_SECTOID_C_UFOPEDIA: "The Tribunal of the Sectoids on Cydonia consist of several ranks, all with strong psionic powers. Unlike normal sectoids, these beings are specially designed to live longer and have a much sturdier constitution, and they all have limited rights within alien society. It would seem that, while these beings look superficially like Sectoids, they may in fact be part of a race which shares personhood within the alien civilization.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Within the Tribunal are priests which have exceptionally strong psionic powers compared to the sectoids we have seen on Earth."
  STR_FLOATER_C_UFOPEDIA: "Within the Tribunal of the Sectoids on Cydonia, there are a special breed of Floater slaves which serve the Sectoids and perform various menial tasks. Unlike most slave races, however, these Floaters have been made very strong and durable, and they can live for quite a long time. They are also well-trained in combat and will defend the city with their life.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Within the ranks of these Floaters there are Dragoons which carry heavy plasma cannons, Machinists which are armed with fusion launchers, and Shamans which have the ability to psionically stun other creatures."
  STR_CYBERDISC_C_UFOPEDIA: "The Ancient City of Cydonia is guarded by particularly expensive and durable sentry machines, strongly armoured, and armed with an exceptionally powerful and accurate plasma cannon. These are similar to normal Cyberdiscs, except much worse. These should most certainly be the primary targets, the first defences we eliminate."
  STR_REAPER_C_UFOPEDIA: "The Cydonian Tribunal is anticipating our arrival and in order to better defend it, they have begun growing particularly strong and durable Reapers which they are covering with the material that Mutons wear for armour. These are fast, terrifyingly powerful, and have an immensely high amount of vitality. We could easily become overrun with these if we are not careful."
  STR_ETHEREAL_C_UFOPEDIA: "Deep inside Cydonia there reside Ethereals much like the ones on Earth, only these ones are older and wiser. They are no less afraid, however, and will be hiding within the city underbelly, hoping we never get past the surface. Do not be caught off guard, Commander, for they have incredibly potent psionic power. Perhaps if we keep them terrified and panicking, they will never have a chance to use their mental powers against us."
  STR_CHRYSSALID_C_UFOPEDIA: "The tunnels beneath Cydonia will be difficult to navigate, and lurking down there will be powerful Chryssalids with an enhanced ability to punch through X-Com armor. As usual, they are best confronted either from the air or with tanks, however do keep in mind that you won't always have room to fly, nor will you always have room to drive tanks. Explosives will be very useful for clearing paths for travel, and they will also be good for killing these chryssalids."
  STR_SILACOID_C_UFOPEDIA: "The alien locus, the ''brain'', is guarded by particularly strong and sturdy Silacoids. From the moment we arrive within the bowels of the city, these Silacoids will be on the prowl looking to ambush our soldiers. They can sense us past walls, however even with psionic armour we cannot sense them coming."
  STR_CELATID_C_UFOPEDIA: "Throughout the maze of tunnels underneath Cydonia, there live several very durable Celatids which will not hesitate to spit acid on our soldiers. This acid will deteriorate armor, making soldiers vulnerable to attacks. If our soldiers are hit with acid, we should check the status of their armor and try not to present a damaged flank to the enemy."
  STR_SECTOPOD_C_UFOPEDIA: "The toughest alien we will face lies beneath the alien city. These Sectopods are walking bunkers which will be exceptionally difficult to kill. They are armed with a powerful laser weapon and are swift and accurate. The terrain is difficult for them to navigate, as long as we don't open it up for them. It is entirely possible that, with enough care, we could avoid these Sectopods entirely."
  STR_FINANCE_THOUSANDS: "$1000s"
  STR_UFO_CRASH_RECOVERY_BRIEFING: "Exercise caution - There may be operatives in the UFO or around the crash site. Mission will be successful when all enemy units have been eliminated or neutralised. Recovery of UFO remains, artifacts and alien corpses can then be initiated. To abort the mission return X-Com operatives to transport vehicle and click on the 'Abort Mission' icon."
  STR_UFO_GROUND_ASSAULT_BRIEFING: "Explore landing site and, if possible, gain entry to the UFO. Mission will be successful when all enemy units have been eliminated or neutralised. Recovery of UFO, artifacts and alien corpses can then be initiated. To abort the mission return X-Com operatives to transport vehicle and click on the 'Abort Mission' icon."
  STR_BASE_DEFENSE_BRIEFING: "An Alien vessel has landed nearby. Our base is in severe danger. As per standard procedure all non-combat personnel and X-Com craft have been evacuated. Alien units will enter the base via hangar doors or the access lift. Defend the base and its vital installations at all costs - this is a fight to the death. If you click on the 'abort mission' icon you will concede defeat and lose the base."
  STR_TERROR_MISSION_BRIEFING: "Aliens have erected some sort of beacon which they are using to terrorise the town. You must destroy the beacon, and attempt to save the lives of any civilians in the area by neutralising the alien menace. To abort the mission return X-Com operatives to transport vehicle and click on the 'Abort Mission' icon."
  STR_CYDONIA_BRIEFING: "You have arrived in Cydonia. You gain entry to a large underground complex near the Martian Sphinx. You must destroy the Alien Brain that controls all alien activity. The fate of humanity is in your hands...."
  STR_MARS_CYDONIA_LANDING_BRIEFING: "Your spacecraft has landed in the region of Cydonia on the surface of Mars. Our information indicates that one of the pyramid constructions contains a green access lift to an underground complex. Look for the pyramid with large entrance doors. Once you have assembled all your soldiers in the lift area click on the 'abort mission' icon to continue to the next stage.{NEWLINE}HEAD FOR THE EXIT IMMEDIATELY AND DO NOT WASTE TIME ON THE SURFACE."
  STR_MARS_THE_FINAL_ASSAULT_BRIEFING: "The pyramid lift takes your battle weary soldiers deep below the planet's surface. They arrive in the heart of a large complex of tunnels and chambers. The alien brain is located deeper in the labyrinth to the north (upper right). It must be destroyed if the earth is to be saved from alien enslavement.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}Good Luck!"
  STR_VICTORY_1: "As you enter the chamber you see the alien brain - the object of your quest. Before you can fire it communicates to you via a screen at its base. It implores you to listen to its arguments for survival before you make the decision to pull the trigger..."
  STR_VICTORY_2: "The brain speaks: 'Many millions of years ago the planet you call Mars was alive. This life was brought to a barren planet by our civilisation as it was to yours. For millions of years we have visited your planet and genetically developed your species. You cannot kill us, you are part of us..."
  STR_VICTORY_3: "Here is the center of Martian civilisation - the pyramids built millions of years before yours - by a species which is your ancestor. No planet is beyond our reach. This power could be yours before long. All we ask is your co-operation..."
  STR_VICTORY_4: "The alien brain is interrupted by a burst of hot plasma, and the entire alien force is defeated."
  STR_VICTORY_5: "Once the aliens have lost Mars they have lost the earth. Before long the X-Com research allows humanity to flourish once more, and claim Mars for itself. The alien menace has gone, but for how long, no one knows..."
  STR_GAME_OVER_1: "The aliens attempt to exterminate all humanity, destroying cities and poisoning the air and sea. The resistance of earth armies is futile in the face of vastly superior technology. Surviving generations suffer terrible mutations as they flee alien destruction. They are rounded up into slave camps to help transform earth into an alien colony which is part of some unknown empire."
  STR_GAME_OVER_2: "The knowledge gained through the X-Com project is lost forever. You have failed to save the earth."
  STR_YOU_HAVE_FAILED: "You have failed to stop the alien onslaught. One by one the funding nations sign pacts with aliens promising technology, prosperity and peace. However it soon becomes clear that the aliens have other plans..."

  STR_ALIEN_HOME_INVASION: "The Final Invasion"
  STR_ALIEN_HOME_DEFENSE: "What We can Expect to Meet on Cydonia"
  STR_SNAKEMAN_INVASION: "Snakeman Invasion"
  STR_ELITE_ALIENS: "Elite Aliens"
  STR_ALIEN_ORIGINS_UFOPEDIA: "It is clear that we are fighting a losing battle on earth. The alien hordes are overwhelming in number. The best we can do is slow down their progress. The only hope for humanity is to tackle the aliens at their source. Our research seems to indicate a nearby base of operations within our solar system. Aliens indicate this place to be the center of an ancient civilisation that pre-dates human history. We must locate this place as soon as possible. However, we need to capture and interrogate aliens across their command structure to gain more detailed information. The larger UFOs probably contain at least one Alien leader. We will also need to interrogate at least one of each operative rank: navigator, medic, and engineer."
  STR_THE_MARTIAN_SOLUTION_UFOPEDIA: "Our research now points to Mars as the base of alien operations. The base is well hidden, and contains all the manufacturing and cloning facilities to fuel the infiltration of earth. It also seems to contain a controlling computer of some kind that controls the whole operation. It seems that the hive-like alien society has some kind of 'queen bee'. This is their fundamental weakness - if we can eliminate the 'brain' then the body will die. We must step up our research efforts before it is too late. In order to progress we must capture the primary links to the alien home base: commanders only reside in alien bases and the largest UFOs; Ethereal navigators are found only within elite invasion forces. We must also research the ability to build a spacecraft so that we can travel to Mars."
  STR_CYDONIA_OR_BUST_UFOPEDIA: "It is now clear that the alien hordes are being controlled from an underground base in Cydonia - which is an unusual area of Mars featuring tetrahedral pyramids and a large formation resembling a human face. Cydonian civilisation once flourished on Mars many millions of years ago, but we do not know why it died out, or what the connection is with the latest alien activity there. Whatever the explanation we must send an expedition to Cydonia. This is the only way that we can defeat the aliens. We must destroy the controlling master 'brain'. We will need a spacecraft equipped with the strongest troops and weaponry at our disposal. There will be powerful elite forces present on Cydonia who will fight to the death to defend their world. To learn more before the assault, we can continue to interrogate more medics and Ethereal navigators."
  STR_ALIEN_INVASION_UFOPEDIA: "The Ethereal Navigator has imparted info on the aliens' attack plans. They have been massing their best combat forces in secret and are preparing to unleash those forces on us in one great final war. Clearly we have rattled them to the point that they will do anything to stop us. We must press forward. The X-Com Project cannot afford to fail.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The aliens will be coming out of hiding and attacking cities more freely, as well as putting more effort into their infiltration attempts. They will be pressuring governments -- not with subterfuge as before, but with fear and ultimatums. They intend to turn the people against us. They will threaten harm to anyone who supports X-Com.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}We must continue to show the people that we can protect them from this threat, otherwise there is no hope."
  STR_ALIEN_INVASION_PSIONIC_UFOPEDIA: "The Ethereal Navigator has divulged crucial information relating to a daring new strategy which the aliens are undertaking. Their best-trained psionic wizards are being deployed to key points around the globe. No longer are they content to remain in hiding. Clearly we have flushed them out.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}This invasion force consists entirely of high-ranking Ethereals and Sectoids, sometimes under the protection of Sectopods. This invasion force will be extremely dangerous to our soldiers, however we cannot allow them to succeed in their plans. If they succeed in their mission, they will begin coercing the Earth's governments to side with them out of fear."
  STR_ALIEN_INVASION_DESTROY_UFOPEDIA: "The Ethereal Navigator has disclosed secret information regarding their plans to win this war. Where previously they were trying for a stealthy victory, now they are coming out of hiding and letting the world know they are here. They will attack cities and massacre people in order to strike fear into the populace. They will try to feign a desire to destroy us, and demonstrate their capability to do so. The goal is to convince Earth's governments to give up the resistance, surrender, and discontinue support for X-Com.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}This invasion force will consist of a few high-ranking Ethereals surrounded by their most destructive soldiers and terrorists. We must defend the people from these forces even at great risk to ourselves, both to protect Earth's inhabitants as well as to demonstrate to the people that they can rely on us for support."
  STR_ALIEN_HOME_INVASION_UFOPEDIA: "The Ethereal Navigator has confessed to us the fear felt by the alien high command. While most of the aliens are slaves, it is the Ethereals who are citizens and masters. They prefer to remain in hiding most of the time, but are coming out now because their very existence is threatened by us.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The Ethereals' home was destroyed by an environmental cataclysm and they now seek to convert Earth into a new home. They did not count on such resistance. If we win this war, it will mean their extinction.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The high council of Ethereals, with extremely potent psionic power, remain safe at their home. Surely they would have beaten us already had the High Council invaded us directly, but they are too afraid to come to us. Perhaps we should come to them first."
  STR_ALIEN_HOME_DEFENSE_UFOPEDIA: "We have finally coerced enough information from Ethereal Navigators to inform us of the forces waiting for us on Cydonia. We can expect to meet several of the races we have seen on Earth, however they will have far stronger armor, and some of them will have stronger psionic powers than anything we've gone up against so far. We should bring a variety of our most powerful weapons; we will need heavy slow-firing weapons, autofire weapons, and powerful demolition explosives.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The races present will be sectoid, floater, ethereal, and several terrorist types. The only aliens not present will be snakemen and mutons."
  STR_SNAKEMAN_INVASION_UFOPEDIA: "We've learned from our research that the aliens have a secret project to unleash their Snakemen against us as a weapon. Snakemen are difficult to control because of their high reproductive rates, so the aliens normally exert full control over their reproductive rights. But a new project seeks to enable the Snakemen to reproduce their species without supervision; they are being genetically adapted to automatically possess the required psionic circuitry such that the aliens will not lose control over them.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}This is bad news for Earth because the Snakemen may become an infestation which could threaten our entire species. X-Com must become the exterminators, and we should seek out the nests they make so that we can destroy them."
  STR_ELITE_ALIENS_UFOPEDIA: "The aliens have demonstrated a capacity to optimise their slave populations to be much stronger in combat than the operative designs we have mostly encountered thus far. Now that we have stirred them to war, we can expect to meet more elite battle troops in the near future.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}We are seeing mutons be the first race to be optimised for intense battle. Whereas before mutons were security troops optimised for long-term deployment to defend installations, the new ones are optimised for brief, energetic skirmishes. Clearly the aliens are afraid, but we have not won this war yet. We must be prepared for what we may yet face in battle."

It is also hardwired to self-destruct when captured by humans. We were unable to understand much of its technology beyond what we could learn from the scraps which remained."
  STR_PLASMA_RIFLE_RED_UFOPEDIA: "This fearsome weapon is more advanced than the previous plasma weaponry and incorporates some elements of human weapon design. It is also hardwired to self-destruct when captured by humans. We were unable to understand much of its technology beyond what we could learn from the scraps which remained."
  STR_HEAVY_PLASMA_RED_UFOPEDIA: "This fearsome weapon is more advanced than the previous plasma weaponry and incorporates some elements of human weapon design. It is also hardwired to self-destruct when captured by humans. We were unable to understand much of its technology beyond what we could learn from the scraps which remained."
  STR_FUSION_LAUNCHER_RED_UFOPEDIA: "This fearsome weapon is more advanced than the previous launchers. It is also hardwired to self-destruct when captured by humans. We were unable to understand much of its technology beyond what we could learn from the scraps which remained."
  STR_ALIEN_GRENADE_RED_UFOPEDIA: "This explosive device is not any more advanced than any of the other alien technology, it is simply designed for maximum destruction rather than strategic strikes. Unfortunately for us, the device is capture-proof and all of its important components are destroyed by the time we collect it from the battlefield."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA_1: "The aliens have always had an enormous technological advantage against us, while we have had an enormous home team advantage since the beginning of the war. As we have begun to conquer their vast technological prowess while simultaneously denying them a foothold on our planet, we, the inferior race, are beginning to gain the upper hand. Perhaps it was fate, then, that we would eventually build this masterpiece of military engineering."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA_2: "It is powerful and compact, sleek and deadly. Utilising the best techniques of both civilisations, thankfully rendered compatible via the aliens' own improvements based on our designs, this weapon demonstrates the sheer capacity our world has to defend itself during war. Let us hope we do not one day abuse this advantage against any other worlds."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA_1: "Our invaders have spent many millennia perfecting their ability to mesh organic with mechanical, technology with biology. To that end, they have successfully conquered many worlds and brought many species into a special kind of genetic servitude. Their slaves have surprised us with astonishingly strong abilities, obtained through eons of genetic and surgical manipulation upon creatures from a multitude of environments."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA_2: "The masters of this army have proven themselves to be a scourge upon our galaxy time and time again, remaining undefeated in their continuous plunder. But perhaps ours was the final stop, their mistakes became too many, and the very biotech they wield shall rise up against them. This mesh of biology, evolution, surgery, and technology is more than capable of eradicating even the most tenacious infestation."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_HEAVY_UFOPEDIA_1: "Laser technology isn't a weapon, according to the aliens, but then neither is plasma. To them, we are mere livestock and genetic stock, plasma is a security tool to keep us from getting out of control, and lasers are for cutting us up neatly on the table. It was we who weaponised this technology. Far more potent than any of our weaponry, it utilises the same supreme manipulation of energy and matter that much of their high-energy technology"
  STR_POWER_SUIT_HEAVY_UFOPEDIA_2: "relies upon, however this iteration is simpler and easier for us livestock to grasp, and to replicate. We truly are animals of war, as is demonstrated when we see every technology through the lens of weaponry. Let this be our one advantage through which we may survive. This powerful laser cannon expends disposable hypercapacitors in order to spell doom for the alien menace."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA_1: "When the war began, the aliens had been launching stun devices at us to control us for their harvest. We struck the first blow, we started the war. In a panic, they cobbled together a fusion weapon, redirecting their spaceflight technology toward a defensive use. They don't even know how to wield this weapon they made, but we do."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA_2: "As we had stolen so many of their technologies before, so too did we make fusion and the launchers of the aliens our weapons. Their second attempt at weaponry borrowed our own technology, and contained a safety mechanism to prevent us from stealing it. Again, it fails and we can yet glean valuable military power from their efforts."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA_3: "The human uprising is not merely a catastrophe, but a great calamity to the aliens; it shall be a cataclysm upon their entire empire, their entire way of life."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA_4: "The Calamity Launcher can be equipped with both a Cataclysm Missile and three Catastrophe Bombs simultaneously.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}The Cataclysm Missile is a high-powered guided warhead, while the Catastrophe Bombs are smaller-yield direct-fire charges."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_LAUNCHER_AP_BOMB_H_UFOPEDIA: "The 'Cataclysm' Piercing Lance combines our layered aerodynamic projectiles technology, itself a mesh between alien hull plating and human ballistic weapons technologies, with the new advanced launcher technology, which itself is alien and human launcher technologies combined into one neat little package. These penetrator missiles carry a tungsten pellet surrounded in a depleted uranium sheathe. It hits the target at nearly the speed of sound, and is able to penetrate even the armour of a main battle tank."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_LAUNCHER_EX_BOMB_H_UFOPEDIA: "The 'Cataclysm' Explosive Missile puts a basic destructive explosive missile into the new launcher, powered by the aliens' own explosive technology. It consists of a highly sophisticated 'catalyst' of sorts, encased within a propellant made of cheap plant starch mixed with oxidizer. This propellant can release considerably more energy than traditional explosives, but does so at a far lower burn rate. The high-tech device is able to set off some sort of detonation wave which triggers the propellant to release its energy all at once in a rapid deflagration comparable to TNT."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_LAUNCHER_F_BOMB_H_UFOPEDIA: "The 'Cataclysm' Fusion Missile really seems appropriately named. Using alien fusion smart-bomb technology, it has the power of our Fusion Rocket but with the tactical movement capability of a Blaster Bomb. The blast radius of alien fusion weapons is reduced using the same technology as their plasma and spacecraft engines. A magnetic confinement field presses inward from the outside, while a focused pulse of gravitons converges at the center, imploding a deuterium charge and converting it to helium, and releasing lots of energy which is then contained within the field and magnified. It is a highly powerful and highly precise tool of erasure. The aliens, it would seem, wanted to forget that we had ever risen against them."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_LAUNCHER_IN_BOMB_H_UFOPEDIA: "The 'Cataclysm' Incendiary Missile is mostly human technology. The thermite incendiary charge is made from aluminium and iron oxide, ignited with magnesium, and spread with a small blast charge. It makes flames many times hotter than normal wood fire, and can melt through flesh or metal given much time. The power of these charges is limited only by size and weight restrictions, and the new launcher tech frees up a lot of capacity to load in more thermite propellant. This missile has the incendiary power of an artillery shell, but can be carried and launched by a single soldier."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_LAUNCHER_SM_BOMB_H_UFOPEDIA: "Cataclysm Smoke Missile"
  STR_POWER_SUIT_LAUNCHER_ST_BOMB_H_UFOPEDIA: "The 'Cataclysm' Stun Missile is very similar to the Blaster Stun Bomb, but more powerful. Using several technological advances gleaned during the war, it has become possible to load two types of ammo into a launcher at once, while simultaneously the missiles are able to carry a greater payload."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_LAUNCHER_AP_BOMB_L_UFOPEDIA: "'Catastrophe' Piercing Bolts are a hard missile which impacts the target to penetrate through thick armour."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_LAUNCHER_EX_BOMB_L_UFOPEDIA: "'Catastrophe' Explosive Bombs are a small yet powerful missile which can blast groups of enemies, shred Reapers, or clear out pesky terrain obstacles such as walls."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_LAUNCHER_F_BOMB_L_UFOPEDIA: "Catastrophe Fusion Bombs"
  STR_POWER_SUIT_LAUNCHER_IN_BOMB_L_UFOPEDIA: "'Catastrophe' Incendiary Bombs are a compact incendiary device which creates hot flames able to melt through large targets, armoured or not, or light our way in darkness."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_LAUNCHER_SM_BOMB_L_UFOPEDIA: "'Catastrophe' Smoke Bombs are a convenient tool for controlling field vision. Most units cannot see through the smoke, however some aliens are not impaired by the smoke. Likewise, some of our armour suits enable us to see through smoke and we can certainly take advantage of this feature."
  STR_POWER_SUIT_LAUNCHER_ST_BOMB_L_UFOPEDIA: "'Catastrophe' Stun Bombs are very similar to the aliens' Stun Bombs, but more powerful. These stun devices can affect living tissue right past whatever metallic armour or body it is hiding within. Only the thickest and sturdiest armours can fully deflect this stun attack."

Reaver's X-Com Harmony - Cheat Sheet

This document was designed to assist me in developing the game. The information contained herein may be
highly spoilerific or the information may be out of date.



DIFFICULTY SETTING:	EFFECTS:

Beginner:		easy armor, easy aircraft, easy aliens, low alien numbers, UFO attack -0gs/retreat -0gs, defeat score -1600
Experienced:		medium armor, easy aircraft, medium aliens, low alien numbers, UFO attack -4gs/retreat -60gs, defeat score -1400
Veteran:		medium armor, medium aircraft, medium aliens, medium alien numbers, UFO attack -8gs/retreat -120gs, defeat score -1200
Genius:			hard armor, medium aircraft, hard aliens, medium alien numbers, UFO attack -12gs/retreat -180gs, defeat score -1000
Superhuman:		hard armor, hard aircraft, hard aliens, high alien numbers, UFO attack -16gs/retreat -240gs, defeat score -800

From Beginner to Experienced:	Armor gets weaker, aliens get tougher
From Experienced to Veteran:	Craft get weaker, more aliens to fight (also means more loot)
From Veteran to Genius:		Armor gets weaker, aliens get tougher
From Genius to Superhuman:	Craft get weaker, more aliens to fight (also means more loot)

Every difficulty increase:	UFO attacks get faster (especially fast-firing UFOs), defeat score gets higher

LAUNCHERS		HOW THEY STACK UP AGAINST EACH OTHER
Rocket Launcher		available at start, has largest and heaviest yet most powerful ammo
Grenade Launcher	available at start, has small and light ammo but isn't very strong; arcing shot
Blaster Launcher	medium ammo, not very heavy, almost as powerful as rockets; waypoints
Small Launcher		lightest ammo, one-handed and quick-firing, low power
Rocket Launcher vs Blaster Launcher: Rockets are significantly more powerful than blaster bombs, but are
	a lot heavier. Blaster bombs also have waypoints. Blaster bombs are more expensive to construct.
	Rockets are more material efficient while blaster bombs are more weight efficient. Most players
	will prefer the utility of the blaster launcher, however the rocket launcher will remain useful
	against the toughest enemies, especially on Superhuman difficulty.
Grenade Launcher vs Small Launcher: Grenade Launcher "grenades" are the same weight as thrown grenades,
	but are a bit less powerful. Both the grenades and the small bombs are a small and light ammo,
	with the small bombs being lighter. Both weapons have similar power per hit. The grenade launcher
	is the only arcing shot weapon in the player's arsenal. The small launcher excels by being light
	and one-handed, and having a faster re-fire rate. The small launcher is an easy launcher to carry
	around in the backpack, or is simply easy to employ on the field in any situation. The grenade
	launcher is more cumbersome, but its arcing shot gives it a special advantage that is useful in
	certain situations.

     The Exterminator with Ascension Suite holds up very well in competition with the Firestorm, both being of very
similar cost and overall potential in many areas. The Firestorm's largest advantages over the Exterminator are
higher evasion and much higher speed; while the Exterminator's largest advantages are stronger armor, longer flight
time when patrolling, a bit more crew capacity, and not spending spacecraft fuel to fly.
     The Firestorm wins out over the Executioner for the most part, with the Executioner's primary advantages being
that it's cheaper, it has higher evasion, and it has a greater radar range.
     Ascension Suite-boosted small weapons are of comparable strength to Combat Suite-boosted medium weapons,
though the mediums tend to be a bit stronger. Medium tractor beams excel in particular. This pairs well with the
Executioner and Exterminator having two and three small pylons with which to mount these boosted weapons, compared
to the Firestorm having only a single medium pylon.
     It is of particular note that both the Executioner (with Ascension Suite) and Firestorm (in general) are
especially good at fighting Terror Ships, while the Exterminator is particularly good at fighting Supply Ships.

CRAFT WEAPON		WHAT IT IS BEST FOR/IDEAL OPPONENTS

Missiles in general:	good DPS but runs out of ammo quickly; can do aggressive attack to shoot faster

Plasma Autocannon	Short-range/high DPS plasma; cheap to fire and great for brawling large UFOs
				Abductor, Harvester, Terror Ship, Supply Ship, Hunter-Killers
Laser Beam		Long-range/high accuracy/low DPS laser; outranges Abductor and Elite Medium Scout
				Small Scout, Medium Scout, Large Scout, Abductor, Harvester
Plasma Beam		Long-range/good DPS plasma; blasts anything small easily; outranges Supply Ship
				Abductor, Harvester, Supply Ship, Terror Ship
Titan Laser Cannon	Medium-range/very high accuracy; blows small UFOs to bits quickly, especially elites
				Small Scout, Medium Scout, Large Scout, Abductor, Harvester
Devastator Plasma	Medium-range/very high per-hit damage; blows large UFOs to bits quickly
				Terror Ship, Supply Ship, Abductor, Harvester

LARGEST UFOS YOU CAN CONSISTENTLY WIN AGAINST ON SUPERHUMAN DIFFICULTY
Tier 1 single craft:	small
Tier 1 tank+DPS:	medium
Tier 1 4-craft squadron:large (with losses)
Tier 2 single craft:	medium
Tier 2 tank+DPS:	large
Tier 2 4-craft squadron:very large (with losses)
Tier 3 single craft:	large
Tier 3 tank+DPS:	very large
Lone Inferno/Flagship:	very large
Starblazer:		very large elite
DESTROYERS FIGHT WITH POWER SIMILAR TO UFOS ONE SIZE LARGER THAN THEMSELVES (PRIMARILY INCREASED POWER)
ELITE VERSIONS FIGHT WITH POWER SIMILAR TO UFOS ONE SIZE LARGER THAN THEMSELVES (PRIMARILY INCREASED HP AND EVASION)
The three most powerful alien craft are the Elite versions of the Battleship, Mothership, and Heavy Destroyer.
The only ship that can consistently beat one of these alone is the Starblazer Flagship.
The Amaranth Flagship is less suitable for air combat, being more comparable to the Tempest or Firestorm.
The Heracles and Divinity Flagships have air power comparable to the Inferno.
STRONGEST UFOS YOU CAN BEAT BY OUTRANGING WITH TORRENT MISSILES
2 racks, no upgrades					90% hit, 900 damage		medium
2 racks, Targeting Computer				120% hit, 990 damage		elite small
2 racks, Critical Computer				100% hit, 1170 damage		elite small
2 racks, both computers					130% hit, 1260 damage		elite small
4 racks, no upgrades					90% hit, 1800 damage		Terror Ship
4 racks, Targeting Computer				120% hit, 1980 damage		elite medium
4 racks, Critical Computer				100% hit, 2340 damage		elite medium
4 racks, both computers					130% hit, 2520 damage		elite medium
6 racks, no upgrades					90% hit, 2700 damage		elite medium
6 racks, Targeting Computer				120% hit, 2970 damage		elite medium
6 racks, Critical Computer				100% hit, 3510 damage		Supply Ship
6 racks, both computers					130% hit, 3780 damage		Supply Ship
8 racks, no upgrades					90% hit, 3600 damage		Supply Ship
8 racks, Targeting Computer				120% hit, 3960 damage		Supply Ship
8 racks, Critical Computer				100% hit, 4680 damage		Elite Supply Ship
8 racks, both computers					130% hit, 5040 damage		Elite Supply Ship
12 racks, no computers					90% hit, 5400 damage		Elite Supply Ship
12 racks, Targeting Computer				120% hit, 5940 damage		Elite Supply Ship
12 racks, Critical Computer				100% hit, 7020 damage		Elite Supply Ship
16 racks, no computers					90% hit, 7200 damage		Elite Supply Ship
The Mothership cannot reliably be beaten with Torrent missiles unless you engage with more than two squadrons.
The Elite Terror Ship and both Battleships are the only ships that cannot be outranged by Torrent missiles.

INITIAL RESEARCH AND PRODUCTION: WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?

What is MOTION SCANNER good for?	Seeing through walls. Combine with smoke.
What is MEDI-KIT good for?		Healing soldiers; keeps wounded soldiers alive and reduces recovery time.
What is SOLDIER SCREENING good for?	You pay more to get soldiers with better specific minimum attributes.
					 - It saves you the process of screening your own soldiers.
What is GUARDIAN/ASSAULT TANKS good for?Guardian Tanks are tough; use them to draw enemy fire or shield soldiers.
					Assault Tanks hit hard; use them to kill enemies that don't die easily.

What is HEAVY ARMOR good for?		Slightly improves soldier survivability at cost of carry weight and TUs.
What is INCENDIARY GRENADE good for?	If you want incendiary in grenade form; provides light and deals damage.
What is SUPER STUN LANCE good for?	It is like the stun rod, except capable of stunning very tough aliens.

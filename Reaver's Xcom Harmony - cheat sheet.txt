Reaver's X-Com Harmony - Cheat Sheet

This document was designed to assist me in developing the game. The information contained herein may contain
spoilers or the information may be out of date.

DIFFICULTY SETTING:	EFFECTS:

Beginner:		easy armor, easy aircraft, easy aliens, low alien numbers, UFO attack -0gs/retreat -0gs, defeat score -1600
Experienced:		easy armor, medium aircraft, medium aliens, low alien numbers, UFO attack -4gs/retreat -60gs, defeat score -1400
Veteran:		medium armor, medium aircraft, medium aliens, medium alien numbers, UFO attack -8gs/retreat -120gs, defeat score -1200
Genius:			medium armor, hard aircraft, hard aliens, medium alien numbers, UFO attack -12gs/retreat -180gs, defeat score -1000
Superhuman:		hard armor, hard aircraft, hard aliens, high alien numbers, UFO attack -16gs/retreat -240gs, defeat score -800

From Beginner to Experienced:	Craft get weaker, aliens get tougher
From Experienced to Veteran:	Armor gets weaker, more aliens to fight (also means more loot)
From Veteran to Genius:		Craft get weaker, aliens get tougher
From Genius to Superhuman:	Armor gets weaker, more aliens to fight (also means more loot)

Every difficulty increase:	UFO attacks get faster (especially fast-firing UFOs), defeat score gets higher

LAUNCHERS		HOW THEY STACK UP AGAINST EACH OTHER
Rocket Launcher		available at start, has largest and heaviest yet most powerful ammo
Grenade Launcher	available at start, has small and light ammo but isn't very strong; arcing shot
Blaster Launcher	medium ammo, not very heavy, almost as powerful as rockets; waypoints
Small Launcher		lightest ammo, one-handed and quick-firing, low power
Rocket Launcher vs Blaster Launcher: Rockets are significantly more powerful than blaster bombs, but are
	a lot heavier. Blaster bombs also have waypoints. Blaster bombs are more expensive to construct.
	Rockets are more material efficient while blaster bombs are more weight efficient. Most players
	will prefer the utility of the blaster launcher, however the rocket launcher will remain useful
	against the toughest enemies, especially on Superhuman difficulty.
Grenade Launcher vs Small Launcher: Grenade Launcher "grenades" are the same weight as thrown grenades,
	but are a bit less powerful. Both the grenades and the small bombs are a small and light ammo,
	with the small bombs being lighter. Both weapons have similar power per hit. The grenade launcher
	is the only arcing shot weapon in the player's arsenal. The small launcher excels by being light
	and one-handed, and having a faster re-fire rate. The small launcher is an easy launcher to carry
	around in the backpack, or is simply easy to employ on the field in any situation. The grenade
	launcher is more cumbersome, but its arcing shot gives it a special advantage that is useful in
	certain situations.

CRAFT WEAPON		WHAT IT IS BEST FOR/IDEAL OPPONENTS

Missiles in general:	good DPS but runs out of ammo quickly; can do aggressive attack to shoot faster
Lasers in general:	high accuracy but poor DPS; ammo is free and they carry lots of it
Plasma in general:	high DPS but ammo costs elerium; generally good against anything
Fusion in general:	very high damage but very expensive ammo; use to blast anything to bits

Cannon/Alloy Cannon	Defense weapon for transports; crash-landing small scouts; DPS scales well with UFO size
				Small Scout, Hunter-Killers
Starling/Shrike		Small missiles, early weapon for Skyraider or Stormcharger
				Small Scout, Medium Scout, Large Scout
Stingray/Scorpion	Short-range weapon, high accuracy/damage/DPS
				Small Scout, Medium Scout, Large Scout, Abductor, Harvester, Hunter-Killers
Avalanche/Torrent	Very long range weapon, low accuracy/damage/DPS/rate of fire; outranges almost anything
				Medium Scout, Large Scout, Abductor, Harvester, Terror Ship (Torrent only)
Light Laser Cannon	Small laser, weak but no ammo cost
				Small Scout, Medium Scout, Large Scout
Pulse Cannon		Short-range/high accuracy/DPS laser; best against small UFOs but can fight larger UFOs
				Medium Scout, Large Scout, Abductor, Supply Ship, Hunter-Killers
Plasma Autocannon	Short-range/high DPS plasma; cheap to fire and great for brawling large UFOs
				Abductor, Harvester, Terror Ship, Supply Ship, Hunter-Killers
Laser Beam		Long-range/high accuracy/low DPS laser; outranges Abductor and Elite Medium Scout
				Small Scout, Medium Scout, Large Scout, Abductor, Harvester
Plasma Beam		Long-range/good DPS plasma; blasts anything small easily; outranges Supply Ship
				Abductor, Harvester, Supply Ship, Terror Ship
Titan Laser Cannon	Medium-range/very high accuracy; blows small UFOs to bits quickly, especially elites
				Small Scout, Medium Scout, Large Scout, Abductor, Harvester
Devastator Plasma	Medium-range/very high per-hit damage; blows large UFOs to bits quickly
				Terror Ship, Supply Ship, Abductor, Harvester
Light Fusion Ball	Very long range, very high accuracy/DPS; blasts smalls or mediums in 1-2 shots
				Abductor, Harvester, Terror Ship, Supply Ship, Battleship
Heavy Fusion Ball	Very long range, extremely high DPS and per-hit damage; can destroy battleships
				Battleship, Supply Ship, Terror Ship


LARGEST UFOS YOU CAN CONSISTENTLY WIN AGAINST ON SUPERHUMAN DIFFICULTY
Tier 1 single craft:	small
Tier 1 tank+DPS:	medium
Tier 1 4-craft squadron:large (with losses)
Tier 2 single craft:	medium
Tier 2 tank+DPS:	large
Tier 2 4-craft squadron:very large (with losses)
Tier 3 single craft:	large
Tier 3 tank+DPS:	very large
Lone Inferno/Flagship:	very large
Starblazer:		very large elite
DESTROYERS FIGHT WITH POWER SIMILAR TO UFOS ONE SIZE LARGER THAN THEMSELVES (PRIMARILY INCREASED POWER)
ELITE VERSIONS FIGHT WITH POWER SIMILAR TO UFOS ONE SIZE LARGER THAN THEMSELVES (PRIMARILY INCREASED HP AND EVASION)
The three most powerful alien craft are the Elite versions of the Battleship, Mothership, and Heavy Destroyer.
The only ship that can consistently beat one of these alone is the Starblazer Flagship.
The Amaranth Flagship is less suitable for air combat, being more comparable to the Tempest or Firestorm.
The Heracles and Divinity Flagships have air power comparable to the Inferno.
